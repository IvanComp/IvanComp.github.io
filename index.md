### BPMN Inspector

**BPMN Inspector**, is a web application designed to streamline the inspection process of BPMN models. The inspection process effectively distinguishes various
model types (i.e. collaboration, choreography, and conversation) while eliminating the need for manual effort in identifying duplicate models, validity issues, and
non-English models. In addition, BPMN Inspector provides detailed insights into
the collection of models by investigating the usage of BPMN notation elements,
their combinations, syntactic violations of the standard and the adherence to established good modeling practices.

### BPMN Grader
(_In Development_)

**BPMN Grader** is a Java tool developed to assist teachers in correcting BPMN diagrams. The tool enables annotations to be added to images of BPMN models, indicating errors made by students while modeling the process. The Annotations that
can be included in the model are defined by a framework which includes common
errors when modeling BPMN diagrams. The aim is to provide graphic and immediate feedback to the student, improving their learning in BPMN process modeling.
