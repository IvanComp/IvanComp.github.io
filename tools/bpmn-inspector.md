**BPMN Inspector** is a web application designed to streamline the inspection process of BPMN models. The inspection process effectively distinguishes various model types (i.e., collaboration, choreography, and conversation) while eliminating the need for manual effort in identifying duplicate models, validity issues, and non-English models. 

### Features:
- Distinguishes collaboration, choreography, and conversation models.
- Detects duplicate models and validity issues.
- Provides detailed quantitative insights on BPMN notation elements.
