### BPMN Inspector

**BPMN Inspector**, is a web application designed to streamline the inspection process of BPMN models. The inspection process effectively distinguishes various
model types (i.e. collaboration, choreography, and conversation) while eliminating the need for manual effort in identifying duplicate models, validity issues, and
non-English models. In addition, BPMN Inspector provides detailed insights into
the collection of models by investigating the usage of BPMN notation elements,
their combinations, syntactic violations of the standard and the adherence to established good modeling practices.
