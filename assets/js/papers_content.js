Business Process Model and Notation is the de facto stan- dard for graphically modelling business processes. Since its \ufb01rst release in 2004, it evolved until reaching the actual 2.0 version, which presents more than 85 elements. Despite the notation being rich in graphical el- ements, initial studies show that only a subset of the BPMN elements is actually used. This paper aims at investigating whether the BPMN vocabulary adopted nowadays by model designers shows some particular trends. We collected 25,590 models from six online repositories to con- duct such an investigation, and we analysed them. We report and discuss the obtained results providing insights on the correlations in the BPMN vocabulary and the resulting complexity of BPMN models. Keywords: BPMN \u00b7 Business Process Modelling \u00b7 Models Repositories 1 Introduction Business Process Model and Notation1 (BPMN) is an OMG standard [19] which provides a graphical notation for the modelling of business processes. The no- tation emerged as the de facto standard to support business process modelling for all the business stakeholders (e.g., business analysts who create and re\ufb01ne the processes, technical developers who implement them, business managers who monitor and manage them). The success of BPMN comes from its versatility and capability to represent business processes for di\ufb00erent purposes. The intuitive graphical representation of more than 85 elements made BPMN widely accepted by both the industry and the academia. 2 Thanks to its intuitiveness, BPMN can be easily used to design processes and their interactions. These models can be used to communicate and interchange the business requirements of a busi- ness process and provide the underpinning of the actual process implementation. Therefore, a BPMN model can be understood by all stakeholders involved in the process. Since its \ufb01rst release (May 2004), BPMN has been also protagonist of 1 BPMN 2.0.2 is the latest version released in December 2013 https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2 formally published by ISO as the 2013 edition standard: ISO/IEC 19510. 2 More than 70 tools support BPMN (http://www.bpmn.org) 2 I. Compagnucci et al. several research contributions ranging from studies related to: the usage of the notation (e.g., [1, 10, 18, 21, 3]), the de\ufb01nition of a rigorous semantics for each notation element (e.g, [6, 8, 16, 22]), the evaluation of BPMN models qualities (e.g., [5, 11, 12, 2]), the de\ufb01nition of notation extensions to incorporate speci\ufb01c application domain aspects (e.g., [4, 23]), and many others. This paper reports the results of an investigation on whether the BPMN vocabulary adopted nowadays by model designers shows some particular trends. We collected a total of 25,590 models from six collections, some of which have already been used for conducting research activities. We focused on studying the overall usage of modelling elements and their correlation and combined usage in designing a business process model. We also investigated the complexity of the notation, highlighting the actual di\ufb00erence between the BPMN practical and the theoretical complexity. From the conducted study, we conclude whether or not the usage of the BPMN notation for modelling business processes has changed during the years, especially comparing our results with previous studies conducted on the topic [18]. The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 shows the methodology we used for harvesting BPMN models. Section 3 reports the overall usage of BPMN notation. Section 4 reports about model complexity in terms of model size and variety of elements used. Section 5 highlights the correlation in modelling BPMN elements in combination and also the set of most popular vocabulary subsets of BPMN. A comparison with related works is presented in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 discusses limitations and future work. 2 Models Harvesting For conducting our analysis, we gathered di\ufb00erent repositories of business pro- cess models designed with the BPMN notation. In particular, we refer to six repository such as: BIT process library 3, Camunda BPMN 4, eCH-BPM, Gen- MyModel, GitHub, and RePROSitory. The BIT process library, is composed by 850 BPMN \ufb01les containing abstract business process used by IBM WebSphere Business Modeler V6 and V7. Those models have been made available by IBM for the practical validation of the soundness-checking approaches and tools [9]. The Camunda BPMN collection stores a total amount of 3,739 unique BPMN models designed in BPMN which have been made available, on GitHub5, by the CAMUNDA company. These di- agrams have been designed in BPMN training sessions, which have been given since 2008 until 2015 when the models have been released. TheeCH-BPM model collections includes 117 models downloaded from the eCH process platform6. The published process models are examples of Swiss public administration\u2019s processes 3 The full collection name is \u201cIBM Research GmbH, BIT process library, release 2009\u201d 4 The full collection name is \u201cCamunda BPMN for Research\u201d 5 https://github.com/camunda/bpmn-for-research 6 http://www.ech-bpm.ch/de/process-library Trends on the Usage of BPMN 2.0 from Publicly Available Repositories 3 that, have been designed by the eCH association, in cooperation with municipal- ities, cantons and federal agencies as well as the BPM specialist community. The GenMyModel collection refers to 11,460 models that have been downloaded, at the time of writing, from the GenMyModel platform7. Users can experiment with the platform\u2019s functionalities provided that the designed models will be made publicly available for reuse. The GitHub collection of models actually consists of a set of 17,203 BPMN models publicly available on GitHub that have been retrieved by Heinze et al. with a procedure described in [14]. The RePROSitory collection consists of 560 models that have been harvested, from the proceedings of the BPM conference and manually re-designed with the objective of de\ufb01n- ing a benchmark of models with a solid literature background. The models are available on the RePROSitory8 dedicated platform [7]. For each collection of models we run a \ufb01ltering procedure for removing models with a total number of element less than eight. We derived this threshold value by analysing each models collection and manually inspecting all the models which size was included in a range of zero to ten elements. We concluded that models with a number of elements less than eight were incomplete models that could have compromised the validity of our study. Table 1 reports the amount of models considered from each collection after the application of the \ufb01ltering procedure. At the end of our models harvesting procedure, we gathered a total of 25,590 models.

We based the development of the python script on the tags present in the BPMN 2.0 meta-model9 so to be able to select all the actual BPMN elements plus some of them characterised by the usage of attributes. We ran our script over the 25,590 retrieved models. The source code and all the details about the usage of this script are reported on the PROS Lab GitHub account 10 together with all the extracted data and the data resulting from the performed statistical analysis. 7 https://www.genmymodel.com/ 8 http://pros.unicam.it/reprository 9 https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN/ 10 https://github.com/PROSLab/BPMN-element-counter 4 I. Compagnucci et al. 3 Overall Usage of BPMN Elements In this section, we present statistical analysis performed over the entire set of models to detect which BPMN elements have been used to design such models and their frequency. 3.1 Distribution of BPMN Elements over Models Considering the frequency distribution of the individual BPMN elements over the total amount of models we ranked them from the most frequent element to the less frequent. As it can be observed in Fig. 1, the distribution of BPMN elements follows a power-law distribution. In our study we found out that \ufb01ve elements namely Sequence Flow, End None Event, Start None Event, Task, and Exclusive Gatewayare present in more than the 50%of the overall models. In the range between 50% and 20%we found 8 elements respectively Pool, User Task, Lane, Parallel Gateway, Message Flow, Start Message Event, Association and Service Task. Between 20% and 10%we found 7 elements respectively Intermediate Catch Timer Event, Intermediate Catch Message Event, End Ter- minate Event, Event Based Gateway, Collapsed Sub Process, Conditional Event, Text Annotation.The remaining elements of the notation (65 of 85) are present in less than 10% of models. Between 10% and 1%we found 25 elements mainly related to typed tasks, some particular type of events, data related ele- ments (Data Object and Message), grouping elements ( Group), Expanded Sub- Processes and Default Flow. 36 elements over 85 are present in less than 1% of the models, they mainly include particular types of Activities ( Transaction, Ad Hoc Sub Processes, Task Loop Activity, etc.), particular types of Events ( In- termediate Catch Multiple Event, Intermediate Throw Multiple Event, etc.) and other elements such as Choreography Task, Conversation, etc. To deepen our analysis, we also derived and reported in Fig. 2 the average number of occur- rences of a given construct in a model. The reported values are only related to models that present such a construct. From Fig. 1 we notice that 99.65% of the models include a Sequence Flow (ID 1), 11, while from Fig. 2 we notice such a percentage of models presenting around 16 sequence \ufb02ows on average. Some peaks can be seen in Fig. 2 even in correspondence of elements that are not present in many models. It is the case of Choreography Participant (ID 72). It is widespread in 0.07% of the models. 3.2 Frequency Distribution of BPMN Elements We also analysed the frequency distribution of BPMN elements concerning the total amount of elements present in the entire collection of models. In particular, the 25,590 models are composed by 1,038,084 BPMN elements. The frequency 11 As it can be seen from Fig. 1 we associated an ID to each BPMN element so, for presentation purposes, the following analysis and diagrams use the IDs instead of the plain name of the elements.

Starting from the left to the right of the \ufb01gure, we \ufb01nd rank 1, which corresponds to the number of Sequence Flow, rank 2, which corresponds to End None Event, till rank 85, which corresponds to Conversation Link. Besides the frequency distribution of BPMN elements, we also reported the Zip\ufb01an distribution (highlighted in red). The Zip\ufb01an distribu- tion states that the frequency of words in natural languages is inverse to their rank [24]; this juxtaposition allows us to highlight that BPMN exhibits a very close distribution to that one of word usage in natural languages. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 0 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% Fig. 3: Frequency plot of BPMN elements by rank The 85 BPMN elements, according to the standard, can be grouped in eight families: Activities, Gateways, Events, Connecting Objects, Swimlanes, Artefacts, Choreography and Conversation. Therefore, to provide additional insight on the frequency distribution of BPMN elements, we reported in Fig. 4 statistics over their usage grouped by families; we also distinguished between categories in Trends on the Usage of BPMN 2.0 from Publicly Available Repositories 7 which the families can be organised. Where possible, we distinguished between basic elements such as Normal Task, Start/End None events, and their Typed versions, which allow a modeller to represent additional information like the fact that a task can be carried out manually or in an automatic way. To group additional elements of a family that are not part of a speci\ufb01c category, we used the term Others. In Fig 4, we can notice that the most prominent family is the one ofConnect- ing Objects that represents almost half of the used elements (49.51%), of which mostly are Sequence Flow. Concerning the Activities family (22.34%), most of the elements are Tasks (92.39%), more than half of which are Normal Tasks (57.37%); Sub-processes (3.96%) and other (3.65%) activities are less present. About the Events family, we notice a predominance of End (41.17%) and Start (35.16%) Events; most of which are of the basic form None (respectively 80.52% and 70.03%). The other events following are Intermediate (19.28%) and Bound- ary (4.38%) events. Intermediate events are divided into Throwing (28.85%) and Catching (71.05%), instead Boundary events are divided into Interrupting (91.26%) and Non-Interrupting (8.74%). Regarding the Gateways family, the Exclusive Gateway is the most used (54.63%), followed by the Parallel Gateway (35.37%) and the Others (10%). Elements of the Swimlanes family forms the 6.11% of the total and are divided into Pool (47.62%) and the Lanes (52.38%). The Artefacts family forms the 1.5% and most of its elements are Text Annota- tions (53.62%). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Fig. 4: Use of BPMN elements grouped by categories 8 I. Compagnucci et al. 4 Complexity of BPMN Models In this section, we focus on the amount and the types of elements in a model. 4.1 BPMN Models Size It is well known that the size of a BPMN model (i.e. the number of elements that form the model) a\ufb00ects its understandability [17]. Regarding the 25,590 models that we analysed, we detected that a model presents between 40-41 elements on average, with a median of 31 elements, a standard deviation of 63-64 elements, a maximum number of 3,672 elements and a minimum number of 8 elements. To provide an overview, we classi\ufb01ed models based on their size, and we reported those data in Table 2. We divided models into three macro-sets: from 8 to 100, from 101 to 200 and from 201 to over 2000. As we can notice, the \ufb01rst set presents the 96.22% models while the second and third sets respectively present 2.76% and 1.02% of models. The majority of the models (68.61%) are distributed in the classes from 11-20 to 41-50. In particular, the higher concentration is in class 11-20, which presents the 25.5% of models. 8-100 101-200 201-2000+ ClassesN\u00b0of Models% of ModelsClassesN\u00b0of Models% of ModelsClasses N\u00b0of Models% of Models 8-10 2 293 8.96 101-110 117 0.46 201-300 149 0.58 11-20 6 615 25.85 111-120 116 0.45 301-400 64 0.25 21-30 3 793 14.82 121-130 115 0.45 401-500 18 0.07 31-40 3 606 14.09 131-140 61 0.24 501-600 8 0.03 41-50 3 543 13.85 141-150 89 0.35 601-700 5 0.02 51-60 1 259 4.92 151-160 52 0.20 701-800 2 0.01 61-70 1 827 7.14 161-170 49 0.19 801-900 3 0.01 71-80 1 128 4.41 171-180 39 0.15 901-1001 2 0.01 81-90 355 1.39 181-190 43 0.17 1001-2000 4 0.01 91-100 202 0.79 191-200 25 0.1 2000+ 8 0.03 Table 2: Number and percentage of models by size 4.2 Syntactic Complexity of BPMN Models Studies conducted over other graphical notations (i.e., UML [20, 15]) reported that the theoretical complexity of the language (measured by the total number of the modelling elements) is di\ufb00erent from the practical complexity given by the number of elements used in the model. To measure the practical complexity of the BPMN modelling notation, we extracted for each model the number of di\ufb00erent notation elements used. In Fig. 5 we report the syntactic complexity of BPMN models. As we can see, even considering that the BPMN meta-model describes 85 elements, in our collection of models, the majority (over 54%) uses between 5 and 8 types of elements. Less than 1% of the models use more than 18 di\ufb00erent types of BPMN elements. The calculated average of elements types present in a model is 8.85, meaning that a model is designed by using around 8 or 9 types of elements. Trends on the Usage of BPMN 2.0 from Publicly Available Repositories 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Fig. 5: Syntactic complexity of BPMN models 4.3 Variety of BPMN Subsets For inspecting the variety of BPMN elements used in models, we used the Ham- ming Distance. The Hamming Distance refers to the number of di\ufb00erent charac- ters in two strings [13]. To calculate the Hamming Distance between two models, we mapped them into binary strings where positive bits signal the presence of a speci\ufb01c BPMN element while negative bits represent their absence. Therefore, for each model, we de\ufb01ned an 85-bit binary string that indicates (using 0s and 1s) which elements each model presents. Then we calculated the Hamming Dis- tance between pair of strings (i.e. between pair of models), and we reported our \ufb01ndings in Fig. 6. As we can notice from the \ufb01gure, a small percentage (0.66%) of models present a Hamming Distance of zero, which means the same type of BPMN elements forms the models; this highlights a high variability in usage BPMN notation. Most of the models (around 60%) di\ufb00er from each other for 6-12 BPMN elements. While really few models (0.57%) di\ufb00er for more than 20 elements, this is also since few models present such an amount of elements. The calculated average dissimilarity between two BPMN models is 8.5, meaning that a model\u2019s vocabulary di\ufb00ers from another by 8 or 9 types of elements. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 Fig. 6: Hamming distance of BPMN vocabularies 10 I. Compagnucci et al. 5 BPMN Elements Correlations To check whether speci\ufb01c BPMN elements are used in combination, we analysed the possible correlation between pairs and groups of elements. 5.1 Correlation Between Pairs of BPMN Elements To analyse pairs of elements, we determined the covariance matrix of all mod- elling elements - a square matrix giving the covariance between each pair of elements. Then we adopted the Pearson correlation coe\ufb03cient ( \u03c1), which corre- sponds to the covariance between two modelling elements divided by the product of their standard deviations, to normalise the covariance measurement to a value ranging between -1 and 1. Negative values represent inverse correlations, while positive values represent direct correlations. When the value is zero, no cor- relation is present; while the more the value is close to \u00b11, the stronger the correlation. In our analysis we distinguished between three degree of correlation: small when the value lies below \u00b10.29, medium when the value lies between \u00b10.30 and \u00b10.49, strong when the value lies between \u00b10.50 and \u00b11. For presen- tation purposes, in Table 3 we report only the most signi\ufb01cant pairs of elements that presented a strong direct correlation. None of the elements pairs presented a medium/strong inverse correlation. The pairs presenting a small inverse corre- lation indicate typed elements at the expense of the not typed ones. It is the case of a model presenting typed elements such as Send Task, Receive Task, Man- ual Task, Business Task may not present the not typed Task element. Moreover, rarely used elements presented a small inverse correlation with many of the other elements. For what concerns the Strong correlations, we report in the following our interpretation of the obtained results. The highest correlation value corresponds to \u03c1 = 0.87, and it is obtained by the pair Exclusive Gateway-Sequence Flow; Exclusive Gateways are used to split the work\ufb02ow into multiple branches using multiple Sequence Flows. It is reasonable, therefore, to notice this strong corre- lation. Send Taskand Receive Taskpresent a correlation coe\ufb03cient of \u03c1= 0.79. Those elements are used to model communication aspects regarding a single or multiple communicating processes, and their strong correlation is straightfor- ward. The pair composed by Start Event Noneand End Event Nonehave a cor- Element One Element Two\u03c1 Exclusive GatewaySequence Flow0.87 Send Task Receive Task 0.79 Start Event NoneEnd Event None0.78 Sequence Flow Task 0.71 Expanded SubProcessStart None Event0.67 Inclusive GatewayExclusive Gateway0.65 Exclusive Gateway Task 0.57 Expanded SubProcessEnd None Event0.56 Pool Message Flow0.53 Pool Lane 0.52 Table 3: Correlation coe\ufb03cient between BPMN elements Trends on the Usage of BPMN 2.0 from Publicly Available Repositories 11 relation coe\ufb03cient of \u03c1= 0.78. Generally, a business process model has at least one start event, and one end event explicitly reported and the not typed once (those named None) are the most used. The pair composed by Sequence Flow and Task presents a strong correlation (\u03c1= 0.71) since tasks are key elements in the design of a business process model, and sequence \ufb02ows are attached to tasks for de\ufb01ning the control \ufb02ow. Being and Expanded Sub-Processa business process per se, it is also reasonable that its start and end are represented and strong correlation with Start None Eventand End None Event. It results a \u03c1 value of 0.67 and 0.56, respectively. The Inclusive Gateway and the Exclusive Gateway elements present a correlation coe\ufb03cient \u03c1= 0.65; this means that the Inclusive Gateway, when used, it is used in combination with other gateways and being the Exclusive Gateway the most used one, the correlation is straight forward. The pair Exclusive Gateway-Taskpresents a correlation coe\ufb03cient \u03c1= 0.57; this is expected since both elements are among the most used ones. ThePool element that is generally used to represent the Owner of a process (e.g. a Company) is often (but not always) used in combination with Lanes to distinguish between departments of the same organisation. Therefore a strong correlation with the element Lane (\u03c1= 0.52) has to be expected. The Pool element is also used for representing collaborations of processes which generally corresponds to di\ufb00erent companies collaborating to achieve some goal. Therefore, it is generally used in combination with the Message Flow (\u03c1 = 0 .53) to represent the exchange of messages between the di\ufb00erent parties involved in the process. 5.2 The Combined Use of BPMN Elements After analysing the correlation coe\ufb03cient for pairs of BPMN elements, we anal- ysed groups of elements to \ufb01nd those most frequently used in combination. The Venn diagram in Fig. 7 shows the elements that are most used in com- bination with the respective percentage of the models in which they are present. We reported only those combinations of elements that appeared together in at least 25% of the models. The dashed lines size are used to group the elements so that the shorter the dash, the higher the percentage of models with that com- bination of elements. The elements that are primarily used in combination are Tasks and Sequence Flows with a percentage of 96%. Instead, Start Event and the End Event are present in combination in 91% of the models. The above men- tioned elements (i.e., Task, Sequence Flow, Start and End Event) form a core set of elements that are mostly used in combination; they are present together in 89% of the models. Additional elements combined with the core set are de- limited with a green dashed line. The combination of the core set with Exclusive Gateway is present in 50% of the models, with Pool in 44% of the models, with Parallel Gateways present in 31% of the models, with Intermediate Events is present in 30% of the models. On the right side of the \ufb01gure, we reported the combination of Lanes and Message Flows with the Pool element, which respec- tively are present in combination in 37% and 27% of the models. In particular, these elements are related to the modelling of Organisational aspects (i.e., the owner of the process represented by a Pool of other company departments by 12 I. Compagnucci et al. Lanes) and the modelling of processes collaborations (i.e., Pools with processes that communicate via message \ufb02ows). It is worth noticing that typed elements (e.g, User Task, Message Event, Timer Event, etc.) are not included in any of the most popular BPMN element subsets. 91%89% 96% 50% 32% 30% 37% 27% 44% Pool Lane Lane Intermediate Event Parallel Gateway Exclusive Gateway Start Event End Event Task Sequence Flow Message Flow Fig. 7: Most popular BPMN vocabulary subsets 6 Comparison with Muehlen and Recker\u2019s work Among the literature targeting BPMN, the contribution that most relates to ours is [18]. The authors analysed the usage of BPMN v1.0 over a set of 120 models. The BPMN version that is currently used is BPMN v2.0 which includes new elements with respect to version one. In fact, in our study, we extract data for 85 BPMN elements respect to the 50 elements described in their work. Also, the signi\ufb01cant amount of models that we retrieved, 25,590, compared to their 120 models, establishes a stronger base for conducting statistical analysis. For what concerns the distribution of the occurrence of elements, both the research works highlight a similar trend in the usage of BPMN elements con- cerning Sequence Flows, Start and End None Events, Tasks, Exclusive Gateway, Pool, Lane, Parallel Gateway and Message Flow being among the most used ele- ments of the notation. The di\ufb00erences in the rankings are evident when we look at those elements that are less used (Multiple Instance, Cancel Events, etc.). However, being among the less used elements, the ranking highly depends on the set of analysed models. Regarding the frequency distribution of BPMN elements divided by ranks, both the analysis of [18] present a distribution that resembles the power law distribution typical of natural languages (Zipf\u2019s law [24]). Thus, we observe that despite the elements added in v2.0 the BPMN language still maintains the fre- quency distribution of typical natural languages, consisting of a few essential elements and a set of barely used ones. Trends on the Usage of BPMN 2.0 from Publicly Available Repositories 13 The set of models we analysed presents a higher variety of elements used, with a maximum of 62 and a higher concentration of models that are composed by a number between 5 and 8 di\ufb00erent elements; in [18] the maximum is 15 di\ufb00erent elements with the majority of models composed by a number between 6 and 12 di\ufb00erent elements. In any case, we con\ufb01rmed that on average a model is designed with a number between 8 and 9 di\ufb00erent types of BPMN elements. In [18], looking at the results obtained from the calculation of the Hamming Distance of BPMN vocabularies, the authors detected a maximum di\ufb00erence of 18 types of elements with the majority of the models di\ufb00ering for 7-8 types of elements. In addition, the authors stated that this value might decrease in the future as wider adoption of BPMN may result in a more homogeneous use of BPMN vocabulary for designing models. Instead, in our results, we obtained a maximum hamming distance of 62, with the majority of the models di\ufb00ering for 6-12 types of elements, therefore assisting to an increase in the variety of BPMN elements used. Referring to correlations between elements of the notation, our \ufb01ndings do not show any signi\ufb01cant (medium and strong) inverse correlation that could lead us to conclude that some elements are actually used alternatively. At the same time, in [18] some inverse correlations are highlighted, but they report a weak interpretation. Instead, for what concerns medium and strong direct correlations, we identi\ufb01ed many more correlations to them. However, some correlations they detected did not result from our analysis (e.g., Lane and Message Flow, Start Message and Exclusive Gateway, Start Message and End Terminate). Referring to the combined usage of BPMN subsets, we obtained results with the same trend of [18]. The pair Task-Sequence Flow it constitutes, for both, the most used combination present in 96% of the analysed models. For all the other combinations we obtained higher percentages denoting a more tight usage of those subsets. Those di\ufb00erences may be due to the di\ufb00erent amount of anal- ysed models (i.e., we analysed 25,590 models while they analysed only 120). In addition, compared to [18], we identi\ufb01ed more subsets that are used in combi- nation, especially the subsets formed by Intermediate Events and the core set and the subset formed by Message Flows and Pool, that did not emerge from the previous contribution. Finally, in Table 4 we report the comparison of the analyses with Muehlen and Recker\u2019s work described above.

The main findings confirm that the majority of the models designed with BPMN 2.0 are designed around a core set of elements (i.e., Task, Sequence Flow, Start Event and End Event), resulting in a large portion of the notation that is rarely used. These findings are consistent with those obtained for BPMN 1.0 [18]. These findings are confirmed by comparing the BPMN theoretical complexity, which corresponds to 85, and the practical complexity of the notation, which corresponds to 8-9 elements on average. Our study clearly emphasises the wide usage of the core set of BPMN elements with respect to the most advanced ones. In addition, our results show that some elements are highly correlated, and some are often used in combination; this also can be taken as a reference while preparing training sessions on BPMN. The emerged results can be taken as a reference for guiding the development of BPMN-related tools, which should focus first on providing support for the most used elements and then for the rest of the notation. The results can also affect training activities suggesting a list of elements (the most used ones) that trainers should focus on first before addressing advanced elements (the less used ones). It should be stated that this research was subject to a limitation given by the analysed models. However, we argue that 25,590 models taken from six different repositories should compose a solid base for generalising the obtained results to general use of BPMN notation. In the future, we plan to extend our study to incorporate additional models possibly coming from real world applications or additional online repositories. We also want to analyse the usage of the BPMN notation by targeting different application domains to discover possible subsets of BPMN elements that better fit an application domain with respect to another. Finally, we envision a study that involves practitioners and fresh BPMN users to evaluate whether and how the experience, gained by practising BPMN, may lead to a differentiated usage of BPMN elements or whether it is the application domain mostly guides the choice of the BPMN elements to use.

However, the large number of notation elements it introduces makes its use quite complex. This work in- vestigates the usage of the BPMN notation by analyzing 54,500 models harvested from seven online collections. The study considers different model types introduced by the standard, such as process collaboration, choreography, and conversation. The analyses focus on the syntactic dimension of BPMN, investigating the usage of BPMN elements and their combinations. Syntactic violations of the standard, and of good modeling practices, are also investigated as well as possible relations with BPMN elements and modeling tools. The results of this study can guide further activities of educators, prac- titioners, researchers, and standardization bodies. Keywords -BPMN; Process Models; Notation Usage; Syntactic Errors; Modeling Practices. 1 Introduction Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) was proposed by the Business Process Modeling Initia- tive in 2004. Since 2013 it has been recognized as a standard1 and consistently maintained by the Object Management Group. In this study, we focus on version 2.0 of the notation 2 and we use the term BPMN to refer to such a version. BPMN holds the promise of providing a standardizedlingua franca easily understood by all business stakeholders (e.g., business analysts, technical developers, and business managers) involved in the de- 1BPMN 2.0.1 version is released as ISO/IEC 19510:2013 standard 2https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0 - Accessed on 9 March 2023 1 sign, implementation, monitoring, and management of the processes (Bork, Karagiannis, & Pittl, 2020; Genon, Heymans, & Amyot, 2010; Recker, Rosemann, Indulska, & Green, 2009). In particular, the adoption of BPMN has been successful thanks to its intuitive graphical nature, which foster the under- standing of business processes by all the involved stakeholders. Moreover, the availability of supporting tools, in the market, positively in\ufb02uenced BPMN adoption.3 If on one side, the intuitive graphical nature of BPMN makes it easy to start with, on the other side, the huge amount of notation elements makes it challenging to master. BPMN includes over two hundred distinct graphical notation elements (see Section 2 for more details). As a result, several BPMN models present modeling issues, such as syntactic errors, poor understandability, etc. In such a setting, inspired by studies conducted on other standard notations such as UML (Dobing & Parsons, 2006; Petre, 2013), we want to shed light on how BPMN notation is used in practice. To guide our study, we de\ufb01ned four research questions. \u2022 RQ1. How many and which notation elements are used to design BPMN models? \u2022 RQ2. Which BPMN elements are used in combination? \u2022 RQ3. Which syntactical errors occur more frequently, and how are they related to BPMN elements and modeling tools? \u2022 RQ4. Which good modeling practices are violated, and how are they related to speci\ufb01c BPMN elements and modeling tools? To answer those questions, we \ufb01rst retrieved a set of54,500 models from seven online BPMN collec- tions, including Process Collaboration, Choreography, and Conversation models, and then we conducted an empirical analysis of such models. In this paper, for presentation purposes, we focus on reporting only the main data and results that contribute to answering the identi\ufb01ed research questions. Additional ma- terials, including all the data and the analysis results, are available online.4 Our work differs from previous studies in the \ufb01eld such as Compagnucci, Corradini, Fornari, and Re (2021); zur Muehlen and Recker (2013) by: (i) considering a broader collection of models, (ii) ana- lyzing different types of models such as process collaborations, choreographies, and conversations, (iii) 3More than 70 tools support BPMN (http://www.bpmn.org - Accessed on 9 March 2023) 4https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10l6QBXVEs_jZ0vQ6o2oQlWyqesHSJqfL - Accessed on 9 March 2023 2 investigating relations between syntactic errors and both elements and modeling tools. (iv) investigating relations between good modeling practices and both elements and modeling tools; (v) making available both data and tools used to conduct our study. The overall results of our study could be used to guide: educators in tailoring their teaching activities, practitioners in the use of the notation, researchers towards novel \ufb01ndings, and standardization bodies on future releases of the standard. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents background knowledge regarding BPMN. Section 3 describes all the steps adopted for conducting this research. Section 4 reports the results of the various analyses we conducted. Section 5 discusses the obtained results. Section 6 reports a comparison of our study with related works. Section 7 reports the implications of the study providing indications for further research activities. Section 8 reports some limitations of our study. Finally, Section 9 summarizes and concludes the paper. 2 Background In this section, we report background information about BPMN elements, types of models, and available BPMN model collections. 2.1 BPMN Core and Extended Sets The BPMN notation includes a core set of elements reported in Figure 1. These elements can be grouped in \ufb02ow objects, connecting objects, swimlanes, and artifacts. The interested reader can refer to the of\ufb01cial BPMN speci\ufb01cation5 for an exhaustive description. The elements can be enriched with symbols (markers) to represent additional information. Markers are reported at the top left corner, or at the bottom center, of the element. Figure 2 reports a task with different combinations of markers (e.g., service, parallel multiple instance, compensation, loop). By treating each element with a unique combination of markers as separate elements, the maximum number of BPMN elements that can be detected is 267. This number corresponds to the theoretical complexity of the notation (Erickson and Siau (2004)), and it tells us that for designing a BPMN model we could use up to 267 different graphical elements. While the size of a model corresponds to the total number of elements present in the model, the practical complexity refers to the number of different types of elements used (Erickson and Siau (2007), Siau, Erickson, and Lee (2005)). As an example, a model that presents one start event, one activity, 5https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/PDF - Accessed on 9 March 2023 3 T ext Annotation Allows a modeler to provide additional information Flow Objects Connecting Objects Swimlanes Artifacts Events Activities Gateways Sequence Flow Message Flow Association Pool Lanes (within a Pool) Data Object T ext Annotation Group Figure 1: Core set of BPMN elements (The Object Management Group, 2011) (a) Normal task (b) Service task (c) Parallel multiple instance task (d) Parallel multiple instance service task (e) Compensate standard loop service task (f) Compensate parallel multiple instance service task (g) Compensate sequential multiple instance service task Figure 2: Different de\ufb01nitions of the task element one end event, and two sequence \ufb02ows connecting the elements has a model size of \ufb01ve, since the total amount of elements is \ufb01ve, but a practical complexity of four, since it uses four different types of elements. 2.2 BPMN Models A relevant aspect of the BPMN standard refers to the adoption of different model types such as: pro- cess, collaboration, choreography, and conversation. A process model describes how a single participant works, a collaboration model describes how multiple participants work and interact with each other, a choreography model describes the exchange of information between participants, and a conversation model provides a high-level representation of groups of messages (conversations) transmitted between process participants. In particular, of the 267 BPMN elements that are included in the standard, 242 4 Client Send Order Check Payment Request Make Payment Receive Product Company Check Order Request Payment Ship Product Receive product not available notification End without product Payment request Receive product available notification Receive payment request Is price ok?

Those numbers correspond to the theoretical complexity of the different models. Some elements are common in all types of models while others are speci\ufb01c to the type of models (e.g., choreography activity and conversation link are speci\ufb01c to choreography and conversation respectively). In addition, since the set of notation elements used for single processes is entirely included in that of collaborations6, in the rest of the study, we will group processes and collaborations into a combined category \u201cprocess collaboration\u201d. Figure 3 reports an example of a business process collaboration while Figure 4 and Figure 5 report the corresponding choreography and conversation models. 6The graphical notation for designing collaborations includes also message \ufb02ows and a message icon that are not present in the notation for designing single processes. 5 Client Company Order Conversation Figure 5: An example of a conversation model The standard admits the possibility to combine elements of different models leading to the design of combined models (e.g., choreography elements can be combined with process elements, see pp. 363- 364 of the BPMN speci\ufb01cation 7). This can impact the practical complexity of the models. It is also noteworthy that BPMN offers the capability to extend the notation by introducing changes to the already available elements by adding new graphical symbols, therefore leading to an increase in the notation\u2019s theoretical complexity. 2.3 BPMN Model Collections For conducting our study we have identi\ufb01ed seven BPMN collections from which we harvested models. Table 1 presents a summary of the repositories that have been considered. The BIT process library collection8 is composed of 850 models that have been made available to researchers by the IBM group for the de\ufb01nition and validation of an approach for checking business process properties (Fahland et al., 2009). The Camunda BPMN collection9 includes 3,739 models cre- ated during BPMN training sessions. The eCH-BPM collection10 is composed of 117 models designed involving BPM specialists and people working in Swiss public municipalities and federal agencies. The GenMyModel collection11 includes 12,172 models derived from the GenMyModel platform. TheGitHub collection12 is composed of 17,314 models publicly available on GitHub that have been retrieved from a systematic mining approach (Heinze, Stefanko, & Amme, 2020). TheRePROSitory collection13 consists of 593 models that have been uploaded on the RePROSitory platform (Corradini, Fornari, Polini, Re, & Tiezzi, 2019). The BPMAI collection14 includes 19,715 models mainly derived from modeling activities carried out by students within academic institutions and made available by the BPM Academic Initiative. 7BPMN speci\ufb01cation: https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/PDF - Accessed on 9 March 2023 8http://www.zurich.ibm.com/csc/bit - Accessed on 9 March 2023 9https://github.com/camunda/bpmn-for-research - Accessed on 9 March 2023 10http://www.ech-bpm.ch/de/process-library - Accessed on 9 March 2023 11https://app.genmymodel.com/explore - Accessed on 9 March 2023 12https://github.com/ViktorStefanko/BPMN_Crawler - Accessed on 9 March 2023 13http://www.pros.unicam.it/reprository - Accessed on 9 March 2023 14https://zenodo.org/record/3758705 - Accessed on 9 March 2023 6 Models Repositories Number of Harvested Models Models Providers Models Origin BIT Process Library 850 IBM Group Industry Camunda BPMN 3739 Camunda Company Training session eCH-BPM 117 Swiss Government Public administration GenMyModel BPMN 12172 GenMyModel\u2019s Users Mixed GitHub BPMN 17314 GitHub\u2019s Users Mixed RePROSitory BPMN 593 RePROSitory\u2019s Users Mixed BPMAI 19715 BPM Academic Initiative Training session Table 1: Overview of harvested models by repository BPMN Models Collection and Inspection BPMN Model Filtering Removal of Models With Size Equal to Zero Duplicates Removal Models and Elements Analysis Figure 6: Graphical representation of the adopted methodology 3 Methods To conduct our analysis, we harvested 54,500 BPMN models scattered among the collections introduced in Section 2. This section describes the methodology we used to conduct the study. We also describe the procedure for \ufb01ltering out duplicate models and models with zero elements. Finally, we report on the type of analyses performed. Figure 6 reports an overview of the adopted methodology. 3.1 BPMN Model Inspection In order to inspect the content of the model collections and to extract information related to the BPMN elements used, we developed and distributed an open-source java application named BPMN Inspector. We report the source code on a GitHub repository. 15 BPMN Inspector can detect and distinguish up to 267 graphical BPMN elements. The java application takes as input a set of BPMN models ( .bpmn) and returns a comma-separated value \ufb01le (.csv) containing for each analyzed model: the type and amount of elements present in the model, the model type (i.e., process collaboration, choreography, conversation), and the tool adopted for the design of the BPMN models. We based the elements detection on the XML tags de\ufb01ned in the BPMN 2.0 schema. As an example, the tag<bpmn:startEvent> identi\ufb01es the presence of a start event while the tag <bpmn:task> identi\ufb01es the presence of a task element. For detecting the modeling editor, the tool relies on the value assigned to the \u201c exporter\u201d and \u201ctar- 15https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BPMN-Analytics-Repository/BPMNInspector - Accessed on 9 March 2023 7 getNamespace\u201d attributes from the .bpmn \ufb01le. As an example, to a model that reports targetNames- pace=\u201chttp://bpmn.io/schema/bpmn\u201d and exporter=\u201cCamunda Modeler\u201d we assign Camunda as the modeling tool. If the exporter attribute is present, we use it as the main indicator otherwise, we rely on the targetNamespace attribute. If none of the two attributes are present, we assign \u201cunde\ufb01ned\u201d to the modeling tool in the .csv \ufb01le. 3.2 BPMN Model Filtering The \ufb01ltering procedure allows for ensuring more truthful analyses. It involves two operations: discarding empty and duplicate models. Overall, from the initial set of 54,500 models, we removed 885 models with 0 elements through the \ufb01ltering procedure. To identify duplicates, we generated a string for each model composed of three different information: (i) the number of occurrences of each element present in a model; (ii) the size of the .bpmn model \ufb01le expressed in kilobytes; (iii) all the labels in the model. Figure 7 provides an example of such a string. We then checked for duplicated strings and removed the corresponding duplicated models. We removed 13,929 models resulting in a collection of 39,695 unique models. The \ufb01nal set consisted of 38,863 process collaboration models, 543 choreography models, and 289 conversation models. 3.3 Models and Elements Analysis We conducted analyses based on the models derived from the \ufb01ltering procedure to address the proposed research questions. Table 2 summarizes the analyses and the tool used. We analyzed a subset of those models according to the research questions. All the analyses were carried out on each type of model (e.g., process collaboration, choreography, and conversation) except for the analyses of the RQ4 that were performed only over valid process collaboration due to the limitation of the tool we used to address the research question. RQ1 BPMN element usage. To determine the number and types of elements used, we \ufb01rst calculated the model size, i.e., the number of elements used to design each model and the number of occurrences of 0100004001103200100..01 4256 EndProcess..StartSendinvoice File Size in Kb List of models labels# of occurrences per each element Figure 7: An example of the string obtained from a model 8 Scope Analysis Tools RQ1 Element Usage Number of BPMN elements used in a model Occurrences of speci\ufb01c BPMN elements BPMN InspectorDistribution of BPMN elements over models Variety of BPMN elements over models RQ2 Combined use of elementsCorrelation between pairs of BPMN elements BPMN InspectorCombination frequency of BPMN elements RQ3 BPMN Syntactic validation Syntactic errors in BPMN models BPMN Validator BPMN element related syntactic errors BPMN InspectorModeling tools related syntactic errors RQ4 BPMN Good modeling practices violations Violation of BPMN good modeling practices BEBoP BPMN element related good modeling practices violationsBPMN InspectorModeling tools related good modeling practices violations Table 2: Analyses performed over BPMN models each of the 267 BPMN elements. To answer this question, we use the BPMN Inspector tool. Then, we calculated the distribution of BPMN elements over the analyzed models to discover whether elements were used in all the models or never used. Finally, we investigated the variety of BPMN elements over models, i.e., the number of different types of BPMN elements used for designing a model (which we also refer to as practical complexity). RQ2 Combined use of BPMN elements . We \ufb01rst checked possible correlations among pairs of BPMN elements to gather information about possible combinations, relying on the Pearson correlation coef\ufb01cient (\u03c1) (Benesty, Chen, Huang, & Cohen, 2009). To perform this analysis, BPMN Inspector relies on a python script that we share on GitHub. 16 Then we targeted groups of elements. We started with the pair of elements that are mostly used in combination, and then we proceeded by adding the element most frequently used with that combination, and so on. Since this type of analysis requires at least two elements, we considered only models with more than one element. RQ3 BPMN syntactic validation. To check whether the collected models include syntactic errors, we compared each model with the BPMN XML schema provided by the OMG group. 17 We conducted the analysis using a validator we developed. The source code of the validator is reported on GitHub 18. The validator detects whether a model is syntactically valid; if not, it lists the errors. Then, BPMN Inspector analyses the errors detected to check whether they could be related to speci\ufb01c BPMN elements or the modeling tools used to design the models. In particular, the error messages specify the type of BPMN element involved, making it possible to check if syntax errors are associated with the element. 16https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BPMN-Analytics-Repository/CorrelationbetweenpairsofBPMNelements/ BPMNPearsonCorrelation.ipynb - Accessed on 9 March 2023- Accessed on 9 March 2023 17https://wiki.xmldation.com- Accessed on 9 March 2023 18https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BPMN-Analytics-Repository/BPMNValidator - Accessed on 9 March 2023 9 An example of an error message is cvc-complex-type.4: Attribute \u201csourceRef\u201d must appear on element \u201cbpmn2:sequenceFlow\u201d which we can clearly relate to the sequenceFlow element. RQ4 BPMN good modeling practices. To determine if the models we collected violated established good modeling practices (Corradini, Ferrari, et al., 2018), we used a tool called BEBoP 19 (understand- aBility vEri\ufb01er for Business Process models). BEBoP is a tool that veri\ufb01es the understandability of busi- ness process models, ensuring that they have been designed according to established modeling practices. It automatically checks whether a model is syntactically correct and adheres to these practices. Then, we used BPMN Inspector to investigate whether modeling practice violations are related to speci\ufb01c BPMN elements or to the modeling tools used for designing the models. 4 Results on BPMN Elements Analysis This section reports the most signi\ufb01cant results from the analysis guided by the research questions. The interested reader can \ufb01nd all the data and the analysis results online.20 4.1 BPMN Element Usage Focusing on the BPMN element usage, we report the analysis results on the number of BPMN elements in a model, the occurrences of speci\ufb01c BPMN elements, and the distribution and variety of elements over models. Number of BPMN elements in a model. Figure 8 reports the percentage of process collaboration, choreography, and conversation models by size. The number of elements in process collaborations ranges from 1 to 3,310, with an average of 32 and a median of 41. On average, choreography models contain 26 elements, ranging from 2 to 159, with a median of 24. Finally, conversation models typically are composed of 17 elements, ranging from 2 to 129, with a median of 12. Occurrences of speci\ufb01c BPMN elements. Table 3 also reports a list of the BPMN elements ranked based on the number of occurrences in the analyzed models. The most used elements in process collab- oration models are sequence \ufb02ow, normal task, message \ufb02ow, lane, end event, and exclusive gateway. Notably, these elements all belong to the BPMN core set. In choreography models, the most used el- ements are choreography participant, sequence \ufb02ow, choreography task, and message. The most used elements in conversation models are conversation links, collapsed pools, and conversation. 19BEBoP tool: https://pros.unicam.it/bebop - Accessed on 9 March 2023 20https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10l6QBXVEs_jZ0vQ6o2oQlWyqesHSJqfL - Accessed on 9 March 2023 10 0,00% 1,00% 2,00% 3,00% 4,00% 5,00% 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51 53 55 57 59 61 63 65 67 69 71 73 75 77 79 81 83 85 87 89 % of models Model size (a) Process collaboration 0,00% 1,00% 2,00% 3,00% 4,00% 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51 53 55 57 59 61 63 65 67 69 71 73 75 77 79 81 83 85 87 89 % of models Model size (b) Choreography 0,00% 5,00% 10,00% 15,00% 20,00% 25,00% 30,00% 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51 53 55 57 59 61 63 65 67 69 71 73 75 77 79 81 83 85 87 89 % of models Model size (c) Conversation Figure 8: Percentage of models by model size 11 Rank (r) Element ( e) Occur. # of Models Prob.

Table 3 reports the number and the percentage of models including a given element (notice that the percentage is calculated over the total amount of ana- lyzed models). In the process collaboration models, the most used elements are six: sequence \ufb02ow, end event, start event, normal task, expanded pool, and lane. We recall that these elements all belong to the BPMN core set. In the choreography models, the most used elements are seven: sequence \ufb02ow, chore- ography task, choreography participant, end event, start event, message, and exclusive gateway. The most used elements in the conversation model are conversation link, collapsed pool, and conversation. Among the elements that are less or never used, we found: call activities, ad-hoc subprocesses, and in general, all the elements with compensation, loop, and multiplicity markers. In particular, the overall results suggest that typed and marked elements are rarely used regardless of the model types (e.g., pro- cess collaboration, choreography, conversation). Moreover, for process collaboration models, the results reported that six elements, namely sequence \ufb02ow 97.40%, end event 81.68%, start event 78.58%, and normal task 73.21%, and expanded pool 56.78%, and lane 52.12% are present in the majority of the models (+50%). Concerning choreography models, the elements that are more present in the models are choreography task 97.05%, choreography participant 96.13%, sequence \ufb02ow 95.21%, end event 84.35% and start event 82.32%. For what concerns conversation models, there are three main elements almost always present: conversation link (98.28%), collapsed pool (97.93%), conversation (77.59%). Variety of BPMN elements over models. We calculated the practical complexity for each BPMN model to measure the variety of the elements. Figure 9 shows the practical complexity of process collab- oration, choreography, and conversation. 84.14% of collaboration models have a practical complexity between 4 and 14 elements. A process collaboration model is designed using an average of 8 elements. 87.29% of the choreography models have a practical complexity between 4 and 9 elements. A choreog- raphy model is designed using an average of 6,5 different elements. 92.73% of conversation models have a practical complexity between 3 and 6 elements. A conversation model is designed using an average of 3,5 different elements. 13 0,00% 2,00% 4,00% 6,00% 8,00% 10,00% 12,00% 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 % of Models Practical Complexity value (a) Process collaboration 0,00% 5,00% 10,00% 15,00% 20,00% 25,00% 30,00% 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 % of Models Practical Complexity value (b) Choreography 0,00% 10,00% 20,00% 30,00% 40,00% 50,00% 60,00% 70,00% 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 % of Models Practical Complexity value (c) Conversation Figure 9: Practical complexity of BPMN models 4.2 Combined Use of BPMN Elements Focusing on detecting possible relations between BPMN elements, we analyzed pairs and then groups of BPMN elements to \ufb01nd those most frequently used. Correlation between pairs of BPMN elements.With this analysis, we inspected possible correlations in the usage of pairs of BPMN elements. 21 In Table 4, we report only the most signi\ufb01cant pairs of elements that presented a positive correlation ( \u03c1 \u2265 0.60). It is worth noticing that none of the pairs presented an inverse correlation. Considering process collaboration models, the association data input and the data input exhibit the strongest correlation, with a coef\ufb01cient of \u03c1 = 0.96. For what concerns choreography models, the strongest correlation is obtained by the pair formed by choreography task and choreography participant (\u03c1 = 0.89). In conversation models, the strongest correlation is obtained by the pair formed by conversation link and conversation element (\u03c1 = 0.95). 21Correlation does not refer to BPMN elements that are necessarily connected but that are both present in a model. 14 Element one Element two \u03c1 Process collaboration association data input data input 0.96 association data output data output 0.81 text annotation association undirected 0.78 sequence \ufb02ow task 0.76 receive task send task 0.75 intermediate throw link event intermediate catch link event 0.72 end event start event 0.65 association data input data output 0.64 association data input association data output 0.63 data input data output 0.63 start event expanded sub-process 0.61 data input association data output 0.61 expanded pool lane 0.60 Choreography choreography task sequence \ufb02ow 0.89 intermediate catch link event intermediate throw link event 0.87 choreography task choreography participant 0.87 choreography participant sequence \ufb02ow 0.85 sequence \ufb02ow exclusive gateway 0.83 text annotation association undirected 0.80 choreography task exclusive gateway 0.68 sequence \ufb02ow end event 0.61 Conversation conversation link conversation element 0.95 association undirected text annotation 0.88 group collapsed pool 0.86 message \ufb02ow collapsed pool 0.73 group message \ufb02ow 0.71 Table 4: BPMN elements pairs correlation Combination frequency of BPMN elements.After analyzing the correlation between pairs of BPMN elements, we focused on combinations of BPMN elements to \ufb01nd those most frequently used. The combinations are reported through Venn diagrams. We used dashed lines and colors to indicate different combinations. We started by analyzing combinations within the core notation set that groups elements by families (e.g., exclusive, inclusive, and parallel gateways are grouped under the family named gateways). Figure 10 report the Venn diagram for the core notation. The most frequent combination is formed by activities and sequence \ufb02ows in 93% of the models. If we add events, the resulting combination occurs in 91% of the models. The combination that considers activities, sequence \ufb02ows, and events is the most frequent, and we can refer to it as the core combination. Adding gateways to the core combination results in a combination that occurs in 66% of models, respectively. If we add pools and lanes to the core set, the resulting combination appears respectively in 54% and 48% of the models.

Regarding the most used combination of elements for process collaboration, choreography, and con- versation, we report the corresponding results in Figure 11. The Venn diagram in Figure 11(a) depicts the most used combinations of elements for process collaboration models. The most frequent combina- tion of elements is formed by activities and sequence \ufb02ows, with a percentage of 95% models reporting such a combination. Adding the end event, the percentage of models that reports such a combination decreases to 79%. By adding the start event, the resulting combination is present in 67% of the mod- els. Figure 11(b) shows the most used combinations of elements for choreography models. The most frequent combination of elements comprises choreography task and sequence \ufb02ow, present in 94% of the models. These two types of elements are used in combination with the start event in 81% of the models. Adding the end event results in a combination present in 76% of the models. Choreography task, sequence \ufb02ow, start event, and end event elements form what we can consider the core notation for choreography models. Finally, for the conversation models, the most used combinations of elements are reported in Figure 11(c). Most models (98%) include a pool and a conversation link, while 76% of the models also include the conversation element. 16 79% Exclusive Gateway Parallel Gateway 27% 21% 24% 36% Activities Intermediate Event Sequence Flow 95% End Event 67% Start Event Pool Lane 33% (a) Process collaboration Participant 1 Participant 2 Choreography Task Sequence Flow 94% Start Event 81% End Event 76% Parallel Gateway 15% Choreography Message Association Exclusive Gateway 19% 55% 52% (b) Choreography 3%Association 17% Subconversation Conversation76% 98% Conversation Link Pool (c) Conversation Figure 11: Most popular combinations of BPMN elements by type of model 4.3 BPMN Syntactic Validation We inspected BPMN models to obtain information regarding Syntactic Errors (SE) affecting the design of a BPMN model. Table 5 overviews the number of syntactically correct and incorrect models grouped by the model type. We found sixteen different errors occurring in the entire set of analyzed models. Table 6 lists those errors ordered from the most occurring to the least. The most frequent errors are raised when an unde\ufb01ned type de\ufb01nition is used for an element (SE 1) (e.g., an element is not declared in the BPMN standard schema) and when a mandatory attribute is missing (SE 2) (e.g., a connecting object does not have associated any target element, targetRef attribute is missing). Frequent errors in XML validation include unexpected attribute values outside their schema de\ufb01nition (SE 3) and duplicated ID values that should be unique (SE 4). Other common errors are the incorrect assignment of data types to attribute values (SE 5) and missing namespace de\ufb01nitions for XML nodes (SE 6). 17 Models Process collaboration Choreography Conversation Syntactically Correct 29 112 (75%) 306 (56%) 217 (75%) Syntactically Incorrect 9 751 (25%) 237 (44%) 72 (25%) Table 5: Number of syntactically correct and incorrect models ID Description # of Errors SE1 Unde\ufb01ned type de\ufb01nition is used for an element 34330 SE2 A mandatory attribute is missing in the declaration of an XML node 29211 SE3 The value of an attribute is different from those it could assume following the schema de\ufb01nition 8185 SE4 Multiple occurrences of an ID which must be unique 5853 SE5 The namespace de\ufb01nition of an XML node is missing 3534 SE6 Wrong data type of an XML node attribute 3043 SE7 The content of the element does not match the element type de\ufb01nition or pattern 729 SE8 A corresponding attribute \u201cID\u201d is not present for attribute \u201cIDREF\u201d 492 SE9 A child element is not expected 339 SE10 Missing one or more mandatory child for the XML node 293 SE11 Wrong attribute name in an XML node 201 SE12 Invalid pre\ufb01x of the namespace 31 SE13 Incomplete informations in choreography elements 30 SE14 The element is not de\ufb01ned in the namespace declared 18 SE15 The value of an attribute is not in the enumerations as is de\ufb01ned in the schema 3 SE16 Element not presented in the de\ufb01ned namespace 1 Table 6: Error types extracted in BPMN models Table 7 depicts the most common syntactical errors divided by the model type. Based on the number of models analyzed, choreography models include the most errors on average. Elements and syntactic violations. We identi\ufb01ed 47 different BPMN elements linked to syntactic errors. The errors mainly related to BPMN elements are SE2, SE3, SE5, and SE6. Table 8 reports the elements affected more frequently by errors. The elements with the highest percentage of errors are message \ufb02ows (3.69%) and associations (3.42%). They introduce errors mainly related to SE2, meaning that such connecting objects are often designed without a source or target element. While the other elements that are mainly related to errors are data input (2.30%) and call activities (2.19%), mostly affected by error SE3, which states that the element de\ufb01nition presents a value for an attribute is not coherent with the schema de\ufb01nition. Although a high amount of SE2 and SE3 errors is related to the sequence \ufb02ow element, the total amount of sequence \ufb02ows is so high that the error distribution is low (0.83%), the same can be said for tasks and SE3 errors. 18 Model Type # of models per errors Analyzed model Error distribution SE1 SE2 SE3 SE4 Process collaboration 701 6381 605 392 38863 25% Choreography 0 215 19 19 543 44% Conversation 0 242 3 3 289 25% Table 7: Syntactic errors and their distribution considering model type BPMN Element Errors by ID # of Elements Error distribution SE2 SE3 SE5 SE6 sequence \ufb02ow 5 512 1 816 5 21 658 951 0.83% task 0 1 093 12 20 262 616 0.42% association 2 966 121 0 9 84 982 3.42% exclusive gateway 0 179 1 2 79 737 0.22% message \ufb02ow 2 470 112 0 7 66 820 3.69% lane 0 193 2 0 65 215 0.29% end event 0 172 2 16 63 410 0.29% start event 0 192 0 20 42 707 0.49% user task 0 283 0 27 29 020 1,06% data object 0 25 0 0 19 338 0.12% data input 0 274 5 0 11 882 2.30% service task 0 132 1 10 11 571 1.23% call activity 0 143 0 1 6 553 2.19% Table 8: Errors distribution for BPMN elements Modeling tools and syntactic violations.We inspected possible relations between modeling tools and syntactic errors.

We investigated possible relations between violating good modeling practices and using speci\ufb01c BPMN elements or modeling tools. The modeling practices predicate on different aspects of a model, such as the usage of the BPMN syntax, the assignment of proper labels to BPMN elements, the arrangement of BPMN elements, and the model\u2019s appearance. Table 10 reports evaluated good modeling practices. The \ufb01rst good modeling practices (G1-G5) predicate on general aspects of a BPMN model. In particular, the most violated are G1 and G2, which suggest avoiding overlapping elements (49.82%) and minimizing model size (45.36%). Elements and good modeling practice violations. The rest of the reported good modeling practices (G6-G32) relate to speci\ufb01c families of BPMN elements: activities, events, gateways, connecting objects, swimlanes, and artifacts. Considering activities, it is worth mentioning that the modeling practice: G6 - Provide activity descriptionsis violated in most models (95.96%). Concerning events, the most occurring violations are G8 - Labeling start and end events (58.89%) and G9 - Use start and end events explicitly (33.09%). Referring to gateways, G15 - Labelling XOR gateways (46.31%) and G16 - Use explicit gateways (35.52%). Concerning \ufb02ows, we discovered a high percentage of violations for G22 - Use default \ufb02ows (51.17%), and G23 - Use linear sequence \ufb02ows (22.18%). Concerning the swimlanes, the most violated modeling practices are G27 - Labelling lanes (31.07%) and G28 - Use pools consistently (31.07%). Finally, artifacts elements present violations concerningG31 - Labelling data objectsand G32 - Associate data objects consistently. 20 Scope ID Modeling Practice Violation General G1 Avoid overlapping elements 49.82% G2 Minimize model size 45.36% G3 Keep a standard format 26.27% G4 Use a consistent process orientation 15.67% G5 Document minor details 5.91% Activities G6 Provide activity descriptions 95.96% G7 Labelling activities consistently 34.40% Events G8 Labelling start and end events 58.89% G9 Use start and end events explicitly 33.09% G10 Labelling message events 24.54% G11 Use end events consistently 22.29% G12 Labelling events 21.05% G13 Use start events consistently 8.51% G14 Restrict usage of terminate end event 5.29% Gateways G15 Labelling XOR gateways 46.31% G16 Use explicit gateways 35.52% G17 Mark exclusive gateways 14.64% G18 Labelling AND gateways consistently 8.58% G19 Minimize inclusive OR gateways 5.08% G20 Labelling converging gateways 4.77% G21 Use meaningful gateways 3.64% Connecting objects G22 Use default \ufb02ows 51.17% G23 Use linear sequence \ufb02ows 22.18% G24 Split and join \ufb02ows consistently 11.73% G25 Use message \ufb02ows 10.56% G26 Use linear message \ufb02ows 4.96% Swimlanes G27 Labelling lanes 31.07% G28 Use pools consistently 24.20% G29 Labelling pools 15.81% G30 Use lanes consistently 9.13% Artifacts G31 Labelling data object 5.99% G32 Associate data objects consistently 3.77% Table 10: Good modeling practices and their percentage of violation 21 Modeling tool Modeling practice Analyzed modelsGeneral Activities Flows G1 G3 G4 G6 G22 G23 G26 Signavio 59.09% 49.07% 17.86% 97.63% 67.20% 26.84 % 20.32% 12 661 GenMyModel 64.41% 1.32% 0.12% 97.97% 60.25% 0.00% 0.76% 4 327 Activiti 33.57% 9.03% 26.68% 94.81% 25.59% 38.40% 0.15% 2 005 Camunda 27.66% 4.74% 6.20% 93.98% 36.23% 8.02% 3.47% 1 645 ProM 99.88% 0.00% 0.00% 100.00% 54.10% 99.88% 0.00% 830 bpmn-js 17.52% 4.31% 4.58% 88.68% 24.53% 4.58% 2.70% 371 Yaoqiang 15.00% 18.33% 3.00% 72.33% 12.00% 50.33% 6.00% 300 Eclipse 11.11% 0.79% 2.38% 88.10% 7.14% 6.35% 0.79% 126 jBPM 11.94% 2.99% 1.49% 92.54% 4.48% 4.48% 0.00% 67 Flowable 11.76% 35.29% 9.80% 92.16% 56.86% 23.53% 0.00% 51 Table 11: Percentage of good modeling practices violations considering modeling tools Modeling tools and good modeling practices violations. We inspected possible relations between modeling tools and good modeling practice violations. Table 11 reports the main relations we discovered, highlighting the most signi\ufb01cant values. In particular, models designed with Signavio, GenMyModel, and Activiti present more modeling practice violations than others. The modeling practice G6 - Provide activity descriptions appears to be the most violated independently from the modeling tool used, while G3 - Keep a standard format and G4 - Use a consistent process orientation are not violated by models designed with ProM. Models designed with ProM, jBPM, and Flowable present no violations concerning the modeling practice G26 - Use linear message \ufb02ows. 5 Discussion In this section, we discuss the results obtained from the conducted analyses over the identi\ufb01ed collection to answer the research questions. 5.1 BPMN Elements (RQ.1) To answer \u201cRQ.1 How many and which notation elements are used to design BPMN models?\u201d we analyzed: the number, the occurrences, the type, the distribution, and the variety of BPMN elements used. Concerning the amount of BPMN elements used in a model , it results that 50.86% of the process collaboration models are designed with less than 34 elements. Most choreography models (51.20%) are designed with less than 25 elements. Finally, 55.36% of conversation models are designed with less than 13 elements. What surprised us was the presence of extremely small and extremely big models (i.e., models made of only a few elements or with thousands of elements). Models with small elements can be 22 Figure 12: Process model without sequence \ufb02ows 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Figure 13: Process model without activities regarded as \u201ctesting models\u201d. Users may have designed such models while practicing with a modeling tool or while testing BPMN-related tools (many of them come from the GitHub collection). Inspecting models with an extremely high amount of elements, we noticed three types of models: models that are dif\ufb01cult to visualize but that represent a realistic process 22; models that have been hierarchically struc- tured using sub-processes which elements are stored in the same BPMN model; spaghetti-like models usually discovered from the application of process mining techniques. Concerning the analysis conducted, we inspected the number of occurrences of each element over the harvested models to determine which notation elements are actually usedin designing BPMN models. We found that despite the process collaboration model\u2019s theoretical complexity of 244, 59 elements are never used. Concerning choreography models, which theoretical complexity is 91, 45 elements are never used. Considering conversation models, which theoretical complexity is 11, two elements are never used. Analyzing the distribution of elements, we discovered some models (2.60%) that did not present any sequence \ufb02ow, which is the element used to connect the other BPMN elements. We looked into those models, for which we report an example in Figure 12. We can conclude that they do not correspond to realistic business process representations; they might have been used to conduct tests over BPMN tools. In addition, despite a business process consisting of at least one activity (Weske, 2019, p. 5) (Dumas, Rosa, Mendling, & Reijers, 2018, p. 6), we found 896 models that do not present one. During our manual analysis, we observed a common trend in the design of models that focus only on the control \ufb02ow structure, as seen in Figure 13, or those that rely heavily on events rather than activities, as illustrated by the model in Figure 14. Some of those models are reported in scienti\ufb01c papers to describe approaches predicating only on process aspects. 22A model with over three hundred elements available on RePROSitory: https://pros.unicam.it:4200/guest/modelDetails/24_1552924500764_425164153152522 - Accessed on 9 March 2023 23 Don't send more reminders Send reminder to Client 10 daysSend reminder to Client 10 days Invoice returned? Invoice returned?Yes No Yes Follow up further error No Figure 14: Process model without activities Finally, considering the analysis on the variety of elements used, why some are barely or never used cannot be determined a priori. It may be because some process concepts are not frequently used in real- world scenarios or because industrial models are not disclosed to the public. Designers with different backgrounds and application domains usually design different BPMN models that may require different notation elements (e.g., training and academic models may differ from those used in organizations). It is worth investigating further, requiring additional empirical studies and direct contact with BPMN practitioners and industrial partners. Finally, it is also worth noting that none of the analyzed BPMN models reported elements belonging to different modeling subsets, meaning no \u201ccombined models\u201d were found. None of the modeling tools used to design the analyzed model can support the design of combined models. 5.2 Combinations of BPMN Elements (RQ.2) To answer \u201cRQ.2 Which BPMN elements are used in combination?\u201d we analyzed the correlation between pairs of BPMN elements and groups of elements that are frequently used in combination. Concerning correlations between pairs of BPMN elements, our results show that some elements are highly correlated in designing BPMN models. The strongest correlations pairs of elements for process collaboration models are those related to: data input/output and association data input/output, which indicate whether an artifact is an input or output of a process; sequence \ufb02ow and task, since both are fundamental elements in the design of a business process model. Additionally, receive task and send task are used to cover the process communication aspects, while the end event and start event allow for the initiation and completion of the process. For choreography models, the strongest correlation pair of ele- ments is composed of choreography task and sequence \ufb02ow, allowing to link them. Conversation models\u2019 strongest correlation pair of elements comprises conversation link and conversation since they represent 24 the communication between process participants. No inverse correlation has been found, meaning that overall there is no clear evidence of alternate use of elements. Considering the combination frequency of BPMN elements, our \ufb01ndings show that BPMN models are designed around core sets of elements for each type of model that can be designed with BPMN, as illustrated in Figure 11. The core elements in process collaboration models comprise task, sequence \ufb02ow, start event, and end event. The core set for choreography models comprises choreography task, choreography participant, sequence \ufb02ow, start event and end event for the choreography type, and pool. The core set for conversation models comprises conversation links and conversation elements for the conversation type. 5.3 Syntactic Violations (RQ.3) To answer \u201cRQ3. Which syntactical errors occur more frequently, and how are they related to BPMN elements and modeling tools?\u201d we analyzed syntactic errors in the harvested models, as well as relations with the BPMN elements and the modeling tools used. The study we conducted shows that among the analyzed models, 10,060 are syntactically incorrect. More precisely, 25% of the process collaborations, 44% of the choreographies, and 25% of the conver- sations present syntactic errors. Although choreographies and conversations are designed less often than process collaborations, they present a considerable amount of errors. Among the syntactic errors the most frequent error (SE1) is raised when an element is used but is not de\ufb01ned in the standard BPMN schema, and the schema where the element is de\ufb01ned is not present in the standard BPMN schema. The second most frequent error (SE2) is raised due to an element that, by de\ufb01nition, must have an attribute associated, but such an attribute is missing. Figure 15 depicts an incorrect BPMN model that contains three syntactical errors due to the absence of the attribute required for linking the sequence \ufb02ow ele- ment. Listing 1 provides an example where the \u201ctargetRef\u201d attribute is absent in the XML node of the sequence \ufb02ow. Another frequent error (SE3) occurs when a different value from those speci\ufb01ed in the schema is assigned to an attribute of an element. In some models, we also detected many errors related to duplicated ID values used to identify BPMN elements that should instead be unique (SE4). <bpmn : s e r v i c e T a s k i d =\" A c t i v i t y _ 1 8 3 0 8 b c \" name =\" Send Reminder \"> <bpmn : o u t g o i n g >Flow_1x8xe15 < / bpmn : o u t g o i n g > </bpmn : s e r v i c e T a s k > <bpmn : sequenceFlow i d =\" Flow_1x8xe15 \" s o u r c e R e f =\" A c t i v i t y _ 1 8 3 0 8 b c \"/ > Listing 1: XML de\ufb01nition of a sequence \ufb02ow without the \u201ctargetRef\u201d attribute. 25 Accounting 1st of the Month Determine Billable Hours Create Send Invoice Payment Received Invoice Settled 14 Days Send Reminder No Invoice SE2 SE2 SE2 Figure 15: Syntactically incorrect model presenting sequence \ufb02ows without target elements From our investigation onpossible relations between syntactic errors and BPMN elements usedwe noticed that despite in some cases syntactic errors that violate the BPMN XML schema could be related to BPMN elements, through the error message that directly refers to the element, clear relations exist only concerning the use of connecting objects that happen to be designed without a proper source or target element. The remaining errors do not appear strongly related to the element used. From our investigation onpossible relation between syntactic errors and BPMN modeling tools, we noticed that the modeling tool\u2019s choice clearly impacts the presence of some syntactic errors. Signavio and GenMymodel were the most used modeling tools considering the analyzed models. However, mod- els designed with Signavio (26.54%), GenMyModel (39.63%), jBPM (88.80%), and Eclipse (24.10%) presented a higher error distribution. Models designed with jBPM present an extremely high amount of SE1 errors. Such models are enriched with elements that are related to the Business Rules Management System called Drools, which can be integrated into the jBPM modeling tool, but they are de\ufb01ned in a different schema (the Drools schema), and when validated only with the BPMN XML schema they cause syntactic errors. The most frequent error in models designed with Signavio and GenMyModel corresponds to the missing mandatory XML node attributes (SE2). As mentioned, many of those errors are related to connecting objects that are designed without properly linking to a source or target element. This is a design that some modeling tools allow. The other modeling tools do not allow the design of connecting objects that are not properly linked to their source and target element, therefore they present low or close to zero SE2 errors. Syntactic errors in BPMN models, such as SE3 and SE4, may occur when users assign attribute values to BPMN elements using modelers. For example, customized ID values that do not correspond to valid quali\ufb01ed names (SE3) or ID values that are already assigned to other elements (SE4) can cause 26 errors in the model. Referring to SE4, it is not clear why they are so present in models designed with Sig- navio and GenMyModel since the most recent version of the tools does not allow customized IDs. This might be related to the previous version of the modelers that supported such behavior. This especially is true for models designed with the previous version of the Eclipse modeler that presented a known bug23 \ufb01xed in the most recent versions. Finally, it is worth noticing that most of the latest versions of BPMN modeling tools do not allow the design of models with syntactic errors (e.g., not allowing the design of sequence \ufb02ows with no source or target). This is the case of Camunda, bpmn-js, GenMyModel, Activiti, ProM, jBPM, Yaoqiang, Eclipse, and Flowable. Signavio, on the other hand, allows to design, and save models that contain syntactic errors, warning \ufb01rst the user about such errors. 5.4 Modeling Practices (RQ.4) To answer \u201cRQ4 Which good modeling practices are violated, and how are they related to speci\ufb01c BPMN elements and modeling tools? \u201d we analyzed which good modeling practices are violated by the harvested models, as well as possible relations with the BPMN elements and the modeling tools used. It is well known that when followed, the analyzed good modeling practices support the design of understandable business process models (Corradini, Ferrari, et al., 2018). To guide the discussion, Figure 16 reports a model that presents the main violations of good modeling practices. We added the IDs of the modeling practices in correspondence with the points that clearly show their violations so the reader can refer to such a model while reading the following discussion. Concerning the analysis we conducted on general good modeling practices, we found that the most violated are those that suggest designing models without overlapping elements (G1) (e.g., the data object over the event), maintaining the number of elements used under a certain threshold (G2), keep a standard format without the usage of personalized colors (G3) (e.g., the task \u201cAnalyze Request\u201d depicts a different color). Several good modeling practices predicate over speci\ufb01c BPMN elements and our results show that several of them are often violated. For what concernsActivities, it results that they are rarely accompanied by a description (G6) that could provide more detail about the activity itself and help users of that model better understand the process it represents. In addition, designers often do not assign proper labels to activities, i.e., unique labels with one verb and one object (e.g., \u201cReceive request\u201d, \u201cAnalyze request\u201d), 23https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1024694 - Accessed on 9 March 2023 27 Staff member Start Fill the Form Form to CSR Contact service provider activity for the relevant Insurer team Task 1 End Receive Request Analyze Request ok G29 G27 G9 G26 G3 G8 G31 G1G23 G25 G17 G22 G15 G7 G7G16 Figure 16: Syntactically valid model presenting good modeling practices violations but they use \ufb01ctitious labels (G7) (e.g., \u201cTask 1\u201d) or far too detailed labels (G7) (e.g., \u201cContact service provider activity for the relevant insurer team\u201d). In addition, designers tend to label multiple activities with the same name, a practice admitted only for Call Activities. Regarding Events, several models are designed without explicit start and end events (G9) (e.g., a start event before the task \u201cAnalyze request\u201d is missing), and when they are represented, they are not properly labeled (G8) (e.g., lack of the label on the end event). Modeling practices that predicate over the usage of Gateways are also frequently violated. BPMN introduces some ambiguities that can allow for the representation of a concept in multiple ways. For instance, the splitting and merging of control \ufb02ow can be explicitly illustrated by designing gateways or implicitly represented by connecting multiple sequence \ufb02ow to the same element. However, explicitly reporting gateways can reduce misinterpretations (G16), as illustrated by the missing merging exclusive gateway before the task \u201cTask 1\u201d. When using an exclusive gateway to split a \ufb02ow, giving it a clear label (G15) is important, which should be phrased as a question. Additionally, any sequence \ufb02ows from diverging gateways should be labeled with their corresponding outcome conditions. On the other hand, exclusive gateways used to join the \ufb02ow do not require a label. Figure 16 shows the diverging gateway is only labeled with a generic \u201cok\u201d label, which is not recommended. Some editors enable the modeling of exclusive gateways without markers (G17), such as the one before the \u201cForm to CSR send task\u201d in the example model. However, this could confuse the model user, leading to errors and misunderstandings. 28 For what concerns Connecting Objects, good modeling practices suggest explicitly expressing the default \ufb02ow after designing exclusive and inclusive gateways (G22), which is missing from the task \u201cForm to CSR\u201d. This default \ufb02ow prevents a process from being stuck at a decision point. In fact, the default \ufb02ow will always evaluate as true if all the other sequence \ufb02ow conditions are false. In addition, designing linear sequence \ufb02ows (G23) and linear message \ufb02ows (G26) is frequently violated. In partic- ular, these modeling practices can be challenging to manage in models of big size, resulting in distorted and confusing cross-over \ufb02ows and complicating model comprehension. We highlight such violations in Figure 16. Speci\ufb01cally in the sequence \ufb02ow following the start event (G23) and in the message \ufb02ow originating from the task \u201cContact service provider activity for the relevant insurer team\u201d(G26). Referring to Swimlanes, it emerges that they often lack labeling of their pools (G29) and lanes (G27) elements (as shown in Figure 16 concerning the lower pool). The designers should label lanes and pools to respectively specify the participants in the process as well as their internal roles (e.g., manager, associate), systems (e.g., an enterprise application), or internal departments (e.g., shipping, \ufb01nance). Artifacts in BPMN models are frequently subject to practice violations, often related to their labeling (G31). For example, some data object elements lack labels. When multiple instances of the same data object must be represented, a matching label followed by the relevant state in square brackets should be used. This approach ensures that the changes applied by the activities in the process are properly represented. From our investigation onpossible relations between good modeling practices violations and BPMN modeling tools, we noticed that the choice of the modeling tool has a clear impact on some violations while it is not related to others. In particular, we found that models generated by ProM, a tool that automatically creates BPMN models from event logs or through format conversions rather than manual design, often violate modeling practices related to the visual appearance of the model. These violations include elements overlapping (G1), the use of linear sequence \ufb02ow (G23), and the absence of default \ufb02ow for exclusive gateways (G22). Nevertheless, of course, models automatically designed have the same format (G3) and use a consistent process orientation (G4). Instead, the modeling practices re- ferring to message \ufb02ows (G25 and G26) are not violated since the models designed with ProM do not present such BPMN elements. Models designed with the other modeling tools also present several overlapping elements (G1). This suggests that such modeling practice is violated independently of the adopted tool. Furthermore, models 29 designed using Signavio, Flowable, and Yaoqiang modeling tools violate the best practice of design- ing models with standard formats (G3) because these tools offer customization options for the appear- ance of BPMN elements. For instance, users can change labels\u2019 background color or font, leading to non-standard visual representations of the elements. Although no modeling tool enforces the design of horizontal models (G4), some of them, such as Signavio or Yaoqiang, allow the user to specify the model orientation so that the model is designed vertically or horizontally. In contrast, others such as Camunda, bpmn-js, Activiti, jBPM, and Flowable allow the design of pools only horizontally, limiting the possibility for users to design vertical process collaborations. We noticed that independently from the modeling tool and whether it supports the assignment of a description to an activity or not, the modeling practice that suggests assigning a description to an activity (G6) is the most violated. Also, using default \ufb02ows (G22) is a modeling practice that is often violated but independent of the modeling tool. The modeling practices that suggest using linear sequence \ufb02ows (G23) and linear message \ufb02ows (G26) present different percentages of violation based on the modeling tool used. In particular, some modeling tools, such as Signavio, Activiti, Yaoqiang, and Flowable, present more violations than others, in fact, they do not enforce the design of linear connecting objects, but they allow the user also to design \u201czig-zag \ufb02ows\u201d, while others such as Camunda, bpmn-js, jBPM, and Activiti guide the user in designing linear \ufb02ows, but the user can adjust them also in a non-linear manner adding the number of vertices used to design the \ufb02ow. GenMyModel and Eclipse, instead, guide the user in designing linear \ufb02ows and prevent the user from adding multiple vertices to the connecting objects. 6 Related Work In this section, we compare some research works in the literature targeting statistical analyses concerning the usage of BPMN (zur Muehlen & Recker, 2013) and (Compagnucci et al., 2021). Table 12 reports a summary of the main characteristics of the studies. The former study, zur Muehlen and Recker (2013), analyzed the usage of BPMN considering the \ufb01rst version of the notation (v1.0). The authors distinguished 50 notation elements; and analyzed 126 models, excluding non-sense and duplicate models. Given that the authors focus on BPMN 1.0, we can only compare our results to process models since the standard\u2019s choreography and conversation models have been introduced in version 2.0. The study by Compagnucci et al. (2021), despite focusing on BPMN 2.0, does not perform a \ufb01ne- 30 Muehlen and Recker Compagnucci et al.

They distinguish just 85 elements against the 267 we included by looking at all the different markers related to elements. The authors analyzed a collection of 25,590 models, \ufb01ltering out models with a size smaller than eight elements in an attempt to discard toy-example models. This work focused on BPMN 2.0, analyzing 54,500 models from seven online repositories. We extracted data for 267 different BPMN elements reaching a high level of detail in the analysis of the BPMN notation. In addition, we analyzed the elements of the notation, considering the different types of models that BPMN 2.0 supports (i.e., process collaboration, choreography, and conversation models). Table 13 compares the analysis conducted in the different studies. All the studies analyze the use of BPMN elements and their combinations. Differently from the others, in our study, we also inspect the syntactic validation of the BPMN models and their adherence to good modeling practices, further analyzing possible relations with the BPMN elements and the modeling tools used. Referring to the number of BPMN elements used in the design of a model, zur Muehlen and Recker (2013) did not provide any data. While Compagnucci et al. (2021) present a similar trend to ours, the main difference is that they removed BPMN models with less than eight elements, which in our case count for more than 13% of the models. In the set of models analyzed by Compagnucci et al. (2021) and in ours are some models with an extremely high number of elements (in the order of hundreds and of thousands). 31 Concerning the occurrences and the distribution of notation elements, it emerges that independently from the version of BPMN, the repository used, and the \ufb01ltering procedure adopted, the most used elements are the same for all three studies. Such elements are sequence \ufb02ow, normal task, message \ufb02ow, lane, end event, exclusive gateway, expanded pool, start event, and parallel gateway. In this study and the study by zur Muehlen and Recker (2013), many text annotations have been detected, which were less present in the models analyzed by Compagnucci et al. (2021). Concerning the variety of BPMN elements used in a model, our study, as well as the one by Com- pagnucci et al. (2021), highlight that a process collaboration model is usually designed using different types of BPMN elements in a range between four and fourteen. In the study by zur Muehlen and Recker (2013), models appear to be designed with different types of BPMN elements in a range between four and twelve. This is interesting since both our study and the one by Compagnucci et al. (2021) target models designed with BPMN 2.0 that presents a theoretical complexity much higher than BPMN 1.0 that was used to design models analyzed by zur Muehlen and Recker (2013). So, despite the standard BPMN 2.0 increasing the number of elements that can be used and, therefore, of concepts that can be represented and modeled, model designers have dif\ufb01culties leveraging such an extensive set of elements. Concerning BPMN element correlations, zur Muehlen and Recker (2013) detected some negative ones. However, this may indicate that the analyzed models are not representative enough. In fact, we cannot \ufb01nd any reasonable explanation for why a start or an end event should be used alternatively to an exclusive gateway. Regarding positive correlations, all three studies con\ufb01rm that some notation elements are strongly correlated. For example, the send task and receive task, as well as the pool and message \ufb02ows, are frequently used together to represent message exchange between two process participants. Moreover, end and start events are commonly used to indicate the beginning and end of a process. Finally, throw events and their related catch events are often combined. For what concerns the combined usage of BPMN elementsfrom all the analyzed works emerges that a de-facto core subset of elements is more often used, which includes: task, sequence \ufb02ow, start event, and end event. Then other elements such as exclusive gateway, parallel gateway, intermediate event, pool, and message \ufb02ow are combined with such a subset. 32 7 Implications In this section, we report some implications from the analysis of the results grouped by possible interest- ing targets. Implication for educators.BPMN teaching activities could be better oriented towards focusing \ufb01rst on those elements and combinations that result in being the most used ones. For instance, teaching \ufb01rst the emerged core sets and introducing later typed and marked elements with speci\ufb01c targeted lectures and examples (Figl, 2017). We suggest educators adopt, during training activities, a tool that prevents the creation of syntactically invalid models (i.e., bpmn-js, Camunda) but also introduces other modeling tools that illustrate the major differences that users may \ufb01nd. We also suggest educators focus their activities not only on explaining the usage of the BPMN notation but also on teaching modeling practices, such as those reported in literature (Corradini, Ferrari, et al., 2018) that, if followed, are proved to improve the understandability of the resulting model and may ease its maintainability. In addition, we suggest BPMN educators adopt an open repository platform (e.g., RePROSitory) for sharing training materials within their courses. In particular, BPMN models accompanied with proper descriptions could help clarify doubts about notation usage, fostering good modeling practices. Implication for practitioners. We suggest modeling practitioners, especially novices, carefully select the modeling tool to use since some of them provide a form of support that guides the user in designing syntactically correct models without allowing them to insert syntactic errors and also makes it easier to follow good modeling practices. We also encourage practitioners to adopt the good practice of sharing BPMN models with metadata that provides additional information, such as the domain in which the model has been designed, the domain that it represents, or the designer\u2019s expertise. This practice of providing additional information about BPMN models enables further analysis of the usage of BPMN. Implication for researchers.The research community could be guided toward \ufb01nding why some BPMN elements are rarely or never used. Researchers may try to understand whether their usage depends on the designer\u2019s knowledge of the BPMN notation or whether it depends on the domain of the involved business process. To foster this kind of study, we encourage the research community to share BPMN models enriched with metadata that can help distinguish the origin of the models, the business process domain represented, and the designer\u2019s background. Other characteristics of BPMN models, such as work\ufb02ow patterns (van der Aalst, ter Hofstede, Kiepuszewski, & Barros, 2003) and BPMN model metrics 33 (Recker et al., 2009), could also be investigated. We want to stimulate the research community in trying to de\ufb01ne a way to distinguish realistic busi- ness process models from so-called \u201ctoy-example\u201d or \u201ctesting-models\u201d. In doing so, from the analysis we conducted, we derived some indicators that may suggest the presence of not realistic business process models: 1. model without any sequence \ufb02ow (for process collaboration and choreography) and model without conversation link (for conversation models); 2. process collaboration models without any activ- ity, choreography model without any choreography task, conversation model without any pool;3. model size less than two; 4. model size over three hundred elements; 5. models presenting only one variety of elements. In addition, modeling practices that predicate on choreography and conversation models are missing. Further investigation may be conducted to de\ufb01ne modeling practices that target choreography and con- versation models, providing tools to automatize their evaluation. Furthermore, the research community could bene\ufb01t from establishing collaborations with companies that may allow them to disclose the inves- tigated BPMN models. To prevent reserved information from being disclosed, models could undergo a process of anonymization while still preserving the utility for some studies, such as for reasoning about the kind of elements and modeling practices used in industries. Finally, our results can support the development of BPMN-based tools that use machine learning techniques. To provide an example, Antinori et al. (2022) propose BPMN-Redrawer, a tool for re- drawing BPMN models from images to .bpmn format using supervised machine learning algorithms for detecting BPMN elements. Our study can provide valuable input indicating the most probable/potential elements according to the frequency used, improving the average precision with which BPMN-Redrawer recognizes them. Implication for the standardization bodies.The scarce usage of some BPMN elements could in- dicate a need for a better explanation. New releases of the standard and the documenting materials could include better explanations and examples for using those elements. Some BPMN elements, in particu- lar, have attracted the research community\u2019s attention and have already been discussed, such as the case of the \u201cinclusive gateway\u201d, also referred to as OR-Join, (Christiansen, Carbone, & Hildebrandt, 2010; Corradini, Muzi, Re, Rossi, & Tiezzi, 2022; Dumas, Gro\u00dfkopf, Hettel, & Wynn, 2007). The BPMN 2.0 speci\ufb01cation provides a rather detailed but informal description of its semantics. The association of formal semantics to the standard, chosen between the already proposed ones (Corradini, Fornari, Polini, 34 Re, & Tiezzi, 2018; Dijkman, Dumas, & Ouyang, 2008; Houhou, Baarir, Poizat, Qu\u00e9innec, & Kahloul, 2022; Kossak et al., 2014; Wong & Gibbons, 2011; Ye, Sun, Song, & Wen, 2008), could be a solution to disambiguate the interpretation of the standard. It would be useful to investigate the possible categorization and extension of the BPMN elements based on the process application domain to be modeled. Some combinations of elements may be more frequently used in speci\ufb01c domains. For example, Bourr et al. (2021) identi\ufb01ed a subset of elements for designing multi-robot systems, leveraging the role of the often overlooked timer, conditional, and signal events. For what concerns possible extensions of the BPMN standard, many research works have already contributed to introducing additional elements (Braun & Esswein, 2014; Compagnucci et al., 2020, 2022; Onggo et al., 2018; Strutzenberger, Mangler, & Rinderle-Ma, 2021; Zarour, Benmerzoug, Guermouche, & Drira, 2020). It would be interesting to study and de\ufb01ne a standardization for such BPMN extensions so that the community can refer to the same extended notation when modeling speci\ufb01c domains. 8 Limitations This section highlights the limitations of this study, referring to the quality of the models (i.e., unrealistic models, missing information), the modeling editor used (i.e., missing notation elements), and the tools used for the analyses (i.e., incompatibility with different types of models). Some of the considered models show questionable characteristics, such as the absence of activities, the absence of sequence \ufb02ow, and an extremely low or high number of elements. This may negatively impact results, especially when the number of models is limited. However, since our study was conducted on many models, such characteristics do not affect our results. In addition, we recognize that BPMN models can present custom elements derived from an extension of the standard. We inspected the BPMN tag \u201c<bpmn:extensionElements>\u201d (or \u201c<extensionElements>\u201d) present in the analyzed models, and no additional graphical element has been detected. The majority of the identi\ufb01ed extensions were related to additional metadata associated with already available BPMN elements, such as those referring to the coloring of an element. 24 Other metadata relates to tools that can be integrated with BPMN, such as the rule engine Drools. 25 It is also worth noticing that 3,550 models were missing the exporter and the targetNamespace attributes in their XML \ufb01le. For this reason, we could not derive any information 24The tags <extensionElements> <signavio:signavioMetaData metaKey=\"bgcolor\" metaValue=\"#ffffff\"/> </extensionEle- ments>, are used in Signavio to specify the background color of an element. 25https://www.drools.org - Accessed on 9 March 2023 35 about the editor used and therefore were classi\ufb01ed as unde\ufb01ned. The analyzed models were harvested from different sources and did not present descriptive metadata. Therefore, another limitation of our study is that the analyses were performed on the entire collection regardless of the model\u2019s domain and the designer\u2019s background. This could affect the applicability of our \ufb01ndings in speci\ufb01c domains, such as industrial or healthcare. Considering the different levels of support of BPMN by modeling tools, the usage of some tools concerning others may, in some cases, impact the notation elements at the disposal of model designers. Therefore, BPMN models created using speci\ufb01c modeling tools may have an impact on the results of the analysis. We investigated this aspect, and the only differences that we found can be reconducted to Camunda, bpmn-js and chor-js that do not provide the possibility to design some speci\ufb01c elements: exclusive gateway without markers, data input and data output, multiple events, parallel multiple events, parallel event-based gateway, and exclusive event based gateway. Finally, another limitation of our study relates to evaluating good modeling practices that we con- ducted only on process collaboration models due to the lack of a proper de\ufb01nition and supporting tool for modeling practices over choreography and conversation models. 9 Conclusions In this paper, we investigated the use of the BPMN notation for the design of process collaboration, choreography, and conversation models. To achieve this objective, we de\ufb01ned four research questions that we answered by analyzing a collection of 54,500 models. The study relies on the functionalities of the BPMN Inspector and BPMN Validator that we developed on purpose. In addition, we used the BEBoP tool, which was already available. In particular, our study emphasizes the difference between the theoretical complexity of the BPMN notation (i.e., the total number of elements in the modeling notation) and the practical complexity (i.e., the number of different types of elements that are used for the design of BPMN models). Considering the combined use of elements, we noticed some elements are highly correlated, while no inverse correlation was detected. We also observed that BPMN models (indepen- dently of their type) are designed using a small subset of the notation elements. We explored syntactic errors affecting the models and their relations to using speci\ufb01c BPMN elements and the modeling tools used for designing such models. It emerged that most syntactic errors are related to connecting objects designed with a missing source or target element. Our study shows that the choice of a speci\ufb01c BPMN modeling tool can help designers avoid syntactic errors and in\ufb02uence adherence to certain good modeling 36 practices, especially those referring to the appearance of the model. On the other hand, the violation of good modeling practices related to speci\ufb01c families of elements (i.e., gateways, activities) is not directly related to the choice of the editor used. We also compared our study with related works highlighting differences and similarities. Then, we formulated some suggestions directed to educators, practitioners, researchers, and standardization bodies. In conclusion, despite the results of our study highlighting that some subsets of the BPMN notation are predominant, it does not mean that the elements outside such subsets are to be disregarded. Indeed, in some speci\ufb01c domains, all the elements of the BPMN notation may \ufb01nd their applicability.

To ensure the results validation accuracy of the such research activities, it is important to have an in-depth understanding of the sample models\u2019 features. This mitigates the avoidance of any biased factors that could potentially impact the validation process. In this work, we present BPMN Inspector, a web application designed to streamline the inspection process of BPMN models. The inspection process effectively distinguishes various model types (i.e. collaboration, choreography, and conversation) while eliminating the need for manual effort in identifying duplicate models, validity issues, and non-English models. In addition, BPMN Inspector provides detailed insights into the collection of models by investigating the usage of BPMN notation elements, their combinations, syntactic violations of the standard and the adherence to established good modeling practices.

Introduction BPMN has been widely acknowledged as the standard modeling notation for designing business process models. It holds the promise of providing a standardized lingua franca to represent business processes, which can be easily understood by all stakeholders involved in the business process life cycle [ 1]. Since its release, BPMN models have often been used to validate research activities in the BPM field. The selection of models used for validation plays a crucial role in de- termining the result of novel research approaches. In fact, the validation process of the research activities is directly influenced by the specific features of the models used. Understanding these features provides a solid foundation for a wide range of research activities.

CEUR Workshop Proceedings http://ceur-ws.org ISSN 1613-0073 CEUR Workshop Proceedings (CEUR-WS.org) [3, 4], understanding the features of BPMN models becomes crucial for analyzing and inter- preting the collected data to analyze trends and usage of the notation. Therefore, a reliable benchmark is needed that outlines the characteristics of the models. In this paper, we introduce BPMN Inspector, a web application designed to extract features from a collection of BPMN models. By examining and interpreting the information obtained from the models, researchers can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their research validation process, thereby ensuring the reliability and accuracy of their research findings. Additionally, the tool provides users with the opportunity to access detailed reports. These reports offer comprehensive and structured information about BPMN models, catering to the specific needs of educators, researchers, and standardization bodies. Users can tailor their analyses based on their research objectives, teaching requirements, or standardization goals to obtain relevant implications and suggestions. 2. BPMN Inspector Main Functionalities BPMN Inspector is made available through a RESTful web application, which enables users to upload a set of BPMN models, apply optional filters, and explore their features by performing a set of analyses. The process of inspecting the model collection is depicted in Figure 1 and can be divided into three main phases: BPMN Collection Upload , BPMN Collection Filtering , and BPMN Collection Analysis. 1.BPMN Collection Upload 2.BPMN Collection Filtering 3.BPMN Collection Analysis Upload .bpmn or.zip Files BPMN Models Filter BPMN Models (Optional ) Download BPMN Models Inspect BPMN Models Generate Analyses 's Reports Filtered BPMN Models .csv Reports Figure 1: BPMN Inspector usage phases. BPMN Collection Upload. This is the initial phase where the collection of models is uploaded. One or more BPMN models can be uploaded in file formats such as .bpmn or compressed into a .zip archive. If the file is in .zip format, the content is extracted, and the extensions of the file are examined to exclude any file that does not conform to the .bpmn format. BPMN Collection Filtering. After uploading the models, the preview window is shown. Figure 2 depicts the preview page that allows users to filter and download the models as a .zip file, or inspect the collection by applying optional filters. Each model presents a set of general information such as name, model type (i.e., Process Collaboration, Choreography, or Conversation), whether the model is valid, whether it is duplicated within the collection, Figure 2: From BPMN collection upload to BPMN Collection Filtering. whether the label\u2019s model is in English language, and the file size. The collection can be filtered based on two aspects: model features or model type. Regarding model features, the following filters can be applied: (i) removal of duplicate models; (ii) removal of syntactically invalid models; and (iii) removal of models whose labels are in a language different from English. Duplicate models are identified by reading and comparing all the bytes from each model\u2019s file. To determine syntactically invalid patterns, BPMN Inspector compares each model with the standard BPMN XML schema provided by the OMG. The language of the models is extracted using \u201cLingua\u201d,1 a natural language detection library for Java. Considering the model\u2019s type, they can be filtered differently based on Process Collaboration, Choreography, and Conversation models. The model\u2019s type is detected by analyzing the XML definition of each .bpmn file. BPMN Collection Analysis. This is the main phase of the tool and consists of a set of analyses performed on the collection of BPMN models previously uploaded. The inspection process involves four main analyses: BPMN Element Usage , BPMN Element Combined Usage , BPMN Syntactic Validation, and BPMN Good Modeling Practices . In the following, we report a description of each analysis. BPMN Element Usage. In this analysis, each model of the collection is analyzed by counting the occurrences of each BPMN element. BPMN Inspector is able to distinguish and count up to 267 different BPMN elements [ 4]. Each element is treated as a separate entity based on its unique combination of markers. The analysis generates a .csv report providing detailed information about the element usage enabling a dynamic generation of the graphs. The first graph represents the model size, indicating the total number of elements used in each model\u2019s design. It offers a comprehensive view of the collection\u2019s complexity. Additionally, a practical complexity graph shows the number of distinct types of elements used in each model, providing valuable visual insights into the variety of BPMN elements utilized across the collection. The remaining analysis, focus respectively on the number of occurrences of each BPMN element in 1https://github.com/pemistahl/lingua the collection, providing insights into the frequency of element usage, and the distribution of elements across the collection, indicating the total number of models containing each element. BPMN Element Combined Usage. This analysis aims to identify possible relationships between the BPMN elements within the collection of models. BPMN Inspector performs an analysis of both pairs and groups of BPMN elements to determine the most frequently used combinations. To gather information on possible combinations, the tool calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient [5] for each pair of elements. This coefficient measures the strength of the relation- ship between two elements. The correlation index ranges from -1 to 1, where 0 indicates no correlation, 1 suggests that the elements are used consistently together, and -1 indicates that the elements are used alternatively. The analysis also explores groups of elements, starting with pairs of elements that are frequently used together. Then it expands the groups by adding the element that is most commonly used in combination with that set. This process iterates to automatically generate sets of elements. The tool calculates the percentage of occurrence of these element sets within the model collection using a graph to represent these combinations. Finally, two reports are generated: one containing the Pearson coefficients for each pair of elements, and the second one containing the percentage values of the most used sets of elements. BPMN Syntactic Validation. This analysis focuses on identifying and handling syntactic violations in the BPMN models. Therefore, it will be conducted only if invalid models were not excluded during the filtering procedure. To determine whether the models include syntactic errors, BPMN Inspector compares each model with the standard BPMN XML schema provided by the OMG. The analysis generates a report in the form of a .csv file, which includes the list of the analyzed models. For invalid models, the report also provides an array of errors associated with each model. In the web application, is shown a chart to display the types of errors and their frequency. Additionally, is defined a table, presenting the error codes and providing a link to the XMLdation wiki site. 2 This link directs users to a detailed description of each error. BPMN Good Modeling Practices. This analysis investigates whether the collection of models adheres to a set of established good modeling practices, as defined by [ 6]. To perform this analysis, BPMN Inspector integrates a tool called BEBoP (understandaBility vErifier for Business Process models).3 The analysis results in a .csv report that provides boolean values indicating whether the model meets each guideline or not. In the web application, a radar graph is shown to indicate the percentage of violations considering each good modeling practice. 3. Maturity of the Tool BPMN Inspector was specifically developed as a supporting tool for investigating trends in the usage of the BPMN notation language, enabling research on BPMN development, adoption, usage patterns, and impact. It has been adopted in a study conducted by [ 3], and then in the Business & Information Systems Engineering journal, in the special issue titled \u201c The Impact of the Business Process Model and Notation \u201d[4]. Maturity of the Tool. The maturity of BPMN Inspector was assessed in [ 4] where the analysis involved 54,500 BPMN models obtained from seven online repositories. The evalua- 2https://wiki.xmldation.com 3BEBoP tool: https://pros.unicam.it/bebop tion process of the tool involved the four analyses described above. Starting from the usage of notation elements, the findings revealed that certain subsets of the BPMN notation were predominantly used, emphasizing the gap between theoretical (i.e., the total number of elements in the modeling notation) and practical complexity [ 7] (i.e., the number of different element types used in BPMN models) of the BPMN language. Regarding the combined usage of elements, the study identified strong correlations among certain elements, while no inverse correlation was found. Furthermore, an examination of syntactic errors in the models revealed that the predominant errors were associated with the connection of objects that lacked source or target elements. Furthermore, the study examined the adherence to good modeling practices and found that designers generally don\u2019t follow them. These observations have led to several implications and suggestions for educators, researchers, and standardization bodies. Based on the insights from the study, it is recommended that educators focus on commonly used BPMN elements and combinations in their teaching. Researchers are encouraged to investigate the reasons behind the underutilization of certain BPMN elements. Finally, the study has highlighted the need for better explanations from standardization bodies. 4.

In the last few years, the Internet of Things, via the deployment of sensors and actuators, has heavily been adopted in organizational and industrial settings to monitor and automatize physical processes influencing and enhancing how people and organizations work. Such advancements are now pushed forward by the rise of the Digital Twin paradigm applied to organizational processes. Advanced ways of managing and maintaining business processes come within reach as there is a Digital Twin of a business process - a virtual replica with real-time capabilities of a real process occurring in an organization. Combining business process models with real-time data and simulation capabilities promises to provide a new way to guide day-to-day organization activities. However, integrating Digital Twins and business processes is a non-trivial task, presenting numerous challenges and ambiguities. This manifesto paper aims to contribute to the current state of the art by clarifying the relationship between business processes and Digital Twins, identifying ongoing research and open challenges, thereby shedding light on and driving future exploration of this innovative interplay. \u2217 Corresponding author.

Introduction In the contemporary landscape, organizations constantly strive to enhance and sustain the efficiency and performance of their operational processes. This necessity is fueled by several factors, including the increasing competitiveness of the global market, environmental shifts, variations in resource availability, emergent business opportunities, and the rapid evolution of digital technologies. To meet these challenges effectively, organizations must adopt strategies to constantly optimize their processes, reduce operational costs, and elevate the quality of their products or services [1,2]. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the emergence of a vast amount of interconnected and embedded computing devices with sensing and actuating capabilities, which are transforming how organizations handle their Business Processes (BPs) [3]. While IoT actuators are utilized for process task automation, sensors are employed to gather real-time data, which can facilitate unprecedented opportunities for the discovery and exploitation of new process insights. These insights can be leveraged for the timely detection of anomalies in process execution, efficient process prediction, or to identify potential process improvements. The integration of IoT and BPs has led to the emergence of the term IoT-Enhanced Business Processes (or IoT-Aware Business Processes) [3\u2013 8]. Such a concept is now pushed forward by the rise of Digital Twins, which have become more affordable and promise to drive the future of BPs [9]. \u2018\u2018A Digital Twin (DT) is a virtual representation of real-world entities or processes, synchronized at a specified frequency and fidelity\u2019\u2019 [10]. The DT enables bidirectional data flow between the virtual representation and its physical counterpart allowing for monitoring operations, simulation of what-if scenarios and prediction of future states and outcomes. Information gathered from DTs can be delivered to operators, to control systems, or directly to physical devices that can operate on the entity or process adjusting to optimizing performance [11]. Initially adopted in the manufacturing sector to virtually replicate, simulate, and make predictions on physical assets [12], the concept of DT is now being applied to organizational processes. This provides a new approach to rethinking and re-engineering modern BPs, leading to the possible creation of virtual replicas of actual BPs. These replicas allow for identifying potential issues, predicting outcomes, and optimizing operations through what-if analysis, extending the DT concept across entire BPs [13]. This novel paradigm allows for a dynamic representation of organizational processes and ensures timely responses to unexpected events, optimizing development times and product quality. Additionally, the use of DTs at the organizational level might provide a holistic understanding of organizational dynamics, leading to more effective interventions and efficient organizational design. Integrating DTs and BPs is, however, a non-trivial task presenting numerous challenges. In light of this, an interactive session involving participants of two workshops, namely BP-Meet-IoT1 and DT4BP,2 was held in Utrecht during the 21st International Conference on Business Process Management. The interactive session was aimed to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss the integration of BPs and DTs. The discussion was guided by a set of open research questions that participants were asked to answer. A revised version of these questions is reported below. 1. What is a Digital Twin? 2. What is the role of Digital Twins with respect to Business Processes? 3. What are the challenges of constructing a Digital Twin of a Business Process? During such an interactive session, participants discussed and contextualized ideas, viewpoints, and current findings. This collaborative setting fostered knowledge exchange between participants who provided different perspectives on the topics. Despite some doubts have been expressed on the DT concept, from the discussion it emerged that the integration of DTs and BPs presents interesting opportunities but significant challenges [13,14]. Especially participants emphasized the need for more clarity on the role of DTs with respect to BPs. Starting from that interactive session, a group of twenty-three academics ranging from experienced professors to young researchers, from different academic and research institutions, and with heterogeneous but complementary experiences, was brought together to shed light on the integration between BPs and DTs. The work presented here is based on a combination of literature reviews targeting the integrations of BPs, IoT and DTs, conducted by this group of academics and discussed during periodic online sessions. The online sessions had the objective to derive a unified vision on the integration of BPs and DTs and to define challenges on the integration of BPs and DTs that could inspire furhter research activities. This paper is the result of such a joint effort. With this contribution we aim at providing a common view on the integration of BPs and DTs, contributing to the current state of the art by identifying in-progress research, opportunities, and open challenges that could guide further research. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents background knowledge about DTs and BPs. Section 3 offers a comprehensive overview of the integration between BPs and DTs. Section 4 reports a list of challenges and research directions that we derived both from the literature and the acquired experience of the authors. Finally, Section 5 summarizes and concludes the paper. 2. Background In this section, we report background information on the foundational concepts related to DTs and BPs. 1 https://bp-meet-iot.webs.upv.es/ . 2 https://pros.unicam.it/dt4bp2023/. Internet of Things 30 (2025) 101477 2 F. Fornari et al. Fig. 1. Digital Model, Digital Shadow and Digital Twin representation based on physical and digital spaces. Source: Revised from [16]. 2.1. From digital models to digital twins The evolution of model engineering has radically transformed how we design, develop, and manage complex systems [15]. From creating simple static diagrams, we have advanced to using increasingly sophisticated digital models capable of accurately representing the dynamic behavior of real-world entities [16,17]. In this context, concepts like Digital Model, Digital Shadow, and Digital Twin have emerged [16,18], which we illustrate in Fig. 1. A Digital Model is a digital representation of one or more aspects of a physical entity [16]. Examples of digital models include graphical 2D or 3D representations used by engineers and architects to visualize the spatial dimensions of machinery or buildings and their components. Another type of model involve the use of state machines, which depict the possible states and transitions that a physical entity can undergo. Additionally, workflow models represent the flow of steps and resources involved in tasks, specifying how each task is performed, who performs it, and the sequence of execution. Generally, a single model alone is not sufficient to fully describe a physical entity. Indeed, it may primarily target one perspective of the real entity instead of representing multiple perspectives (e.g., possible actions, current state, spatial dimension) [19]. However, despite their usefulness, digital models are often created manually, resulting in a static representation of reality. Human interventions are often necessary to update and maintain their accuracy and alignment with real-world conditions. This can limit the model\u2019s ability to faithfully represent the physical entity. This is represented in Fig. 1 by the dotted arrow between the physical and digital spaces, indicating a manual flow of data from the physical to the digital space. To address this limitation, integrating real-world data and information with designed digital models is fundamental. Nowadays, the use of IoT allows the real-time collection of data from the physical space, enabling the creation of what is known as a Digital Shadow (DS), which extends digital models of the physical entity integrating real-time data [16]. A DS involves harvesting real-world data to create a digital representation that accurately mirrors a physical entity using digital models and dedicated tools [20]. Continuously updating the model with such data establishes the conditions for faithfully replicating the entity\u2019s current status, enabling the possibility of conducting real-time monitoring of the physical entity. In Fig. 1, this concept is illustrated with a solid arrow pointing from the physical space to the digital space, representing an automatic data flow that enables real-time synchronization of data from the physical object to its digital counterpart. A Digital Twin (DT) is a digital representation that mirrors a real-world entity and that can be used to influence the physical counterpart. Such representation is synchronized with the physical data at a specified frequency and fidelity [10]. Differently from digital shadows that are mainly used for monitoring, a DT has additional enhanced functionalities to analyze and make informed decisions that can be reflected in the physical entity. In fact, DTs not only reflect the current state of their physical counterparts but can also be adopted to simulate the behavior of their physical counterparts, to support decision-making, and to control their influence in the real world. This bidirectional interaction is captured in Fig. 1, where solid arrows point both from the physical space to the digital space and back, indicating a bidirectional automatic data flow. 2.2. Business processes Every organization, whether it is a government agency, a nonprofit organization, or a business, has to deal with the management of several processes [1]. BPs are dynamic series of actions, events, and decisions leading to the creation of a product or the delivery of service [1,2]. These processes are typically embedded within the operations of an organization and are often aligned with specific departments. For instance, within the production department, a BP might include the steps involved in assembling a product [21]. In the logistics department, a process could involve managing the supply chain, from receiving orders to coordinating deliveries to customers. Generally, BPs require continuous adjustment and improvement to remain competitive and efficient over time [1,2]. The management of BPs involve various structured and sequential phases, collectively referred to as the BP Cycle [1,2], as illustrated in Fig. 2. Firstly, the Process Identification phase involves identifying specific processes that require improvement, with careful attention to understanding existing operational challenges [2]. In the Process Discovery phase, the actual BPs are documented and modeled, capturing the as-is process model that represents the current state of processes. Techniques such as process mining can be Internet of Things 30 (2025) 101477 3 F. Fornari et al. Fig. 2. Business process lifecycle [1]. employed during this phase to extract process-related information from event logs, providing a data-driven approach to discovering process details [1]. During the Process Analysis phase, the as-is process model is analyzed to identify weaknesses and their impacts, uncovering inefficiencies and bottlenecks [22]. For instance, techniques like BP simulation can be used here to model potential changes and predict their effects on process performance [23]. The Process Redesign phase then leverages these insights to create the to-be process model, aiming to enhance efficiency and align processes with organizational goals. In the Process Implementation phase, the redesigned process model is executed, ensuring necessary resources, systems, and training are in place to support the new design [1]. Technologies like the process engine facilitate this implementation by automating workflows and managing process execution [24]. Implementation occurs through careful planning and gradual execution, with clear communication and adequate training of participants [1]. Finally, the Process Monitoring phase involves a continuous assessment of the implemented processes\u2019 conformance and performance, gathering insights to evaluate effectiveness and identify further improvement areas. Tools such as dashboards [25] are instrumental in this phase, offering real-time monitoring and analytics to ensure processes are performing as expected. The execution of these phases can be perpetuated to enhance the ongoing process and organizational growth [2]. Nowadays, the use of IoT has drastically reshaped the Information Technology sector, influencing the way organizations conduct business and becoming a key driver in the digital transformation of businesses [3]. In the BP context, IoT devices are usually employed to automate and perform tasks required to achieve a BP goal [3]. These kinds of processes are known as IoT-Enhanced Business Processes [3\u20138]. They involve interconnected smart physical devices with sensing and actuating capabilities that contribute to improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing the quality of products and services. The benefits of using IoT in BPs include increased automation, which reduces human errors, and comprehensive visibility into operations which supports more informed and timely decision-making [3]. Additionally, analyzing data collected through IoT devices can provide additional valuable insights on the target process for improving further analysis and process optimizations. Being the IoT referred to as the backbone of DTs [26\u201328], the widespread adoption of IoT in BPs has enabled the construction of Digital Twins of Business Processes (DTBPs) [29]. This advancement allows for real-time simulation, monitoring, and analysis of entire BPs in a virtual environment. By leveraging DTs and IoT, businesses can conduct accurate simulations, predict outcomes, and optimize processes in the digital space before implementing changes in the real world. This, not only enhances decision-making and improves efficiency but also drives innovation, providing a significant competitive advantage in the market. 3. Business processes meet digital twins In this section, we discuss the integration of BP and DT concepts. To clarify this integration, we report in Fig. 3 a conceptual model that illustrates the relation among a Real-World Business Process, its Process Model, its Digital Shadow, and its Digital Twin. BPs and DTs practices are not far apart. Both BPs and DTs involve the digital representation of real-life entities, gathering data from them, analyzing it, and conducting simulations and optimizations to foster continuous improvement and optimization when enacted in the real world. In the case of BPs, we talk about digital representations of processes or, in some cases, of entire organizations. That said, at the base of Fig. 3 we reported a conceptualization of a Real-World Business Process that is made of entities of the physical space, such as people, systems, IoT devices, documents, etc. that contribute to the process execution. Note Internet of Things 30 (2025) 101477 4 F. Fornari et al. Fig. 3. Connection and data integration between real-world BPs and their digital representations. that a BP could also use DTs of Things (DTTs) which are DTs of physical assets such as machines, devices, etc. that are involved in the process [29]. The first step in studying and possibly improving an ongoing BP is to define a model that represents such a process. We refer to such model as a Business Process Model which corresponds to a digital model in the context of DT. Creating a BP model follows the standard Business Process Management (BPM) approach since BPs typically already exist within the organization [1]. Mainly two kind of BP models are being adopted: imperative and declarative models. Imperative process models represent the whole process behavior at once and can be modeled using different languages such as Petri Nets, BPMN diagrams [30], UML Activity diagrams, etc. Imperative process models represent well the behavior of processes in stable business-oriented environments. Declarative process models are based on the description of BPs through the use of constraints [31]. Such constraints implicitly specify the allowed behavior of the process. Such models can be designed using Declare [32], DCR Graphs [33] and SCIFF [34], etc. Declarative models are been regarded as appropriate for describing dynamic environments where processes are highly flexible and subject to change. While it is possible to start describing the model manually using existing information (e.g., documents, interviews, historical data), techniques such as process mining can facilitate the discovery of processes by analyzing process event logs [22]. BP models can be manually inspected, used as a source of discussion among the process participants, and analyzed by applying standard BPM techniques to investigate their adherence to standard properties (e.g., soundness and safeness) or domain-specific properties [35\u201338]. By linking a BP model with real-time data, we obtain what is known in the context of DTs as a digital shadow. A Business Process Digital Shadow (BPDS) represents the combination of the digital BP model and execution data of the process, offering a quantitative and real-time digital replica of the activities, operations, and workflows of a specific BP instance [39]. A BPDS enables detailed, continuous monitoring of the current process execution. It allows for tracking and monitoring every stage of the BP in real-time, establishing a dynamic and updated view of the ongoing process instance [39]. There can be various sources that provide BP- related data, such as IoT devices, business systems like Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) that provide transactional data and customer interactions, respectively [29]. Additionally, data can be collected from machine logs, employee inputs, and external databases. This data can be integrated and visualized using dashboards or cockpits [40,41]. By continuously monitoring and integrating real-time data with the digital model, a BPDS consolidates an effective basis on which to perform analysis and decision-making, towards an optimization of the BP. A full transition towards the DT concept becomes essential to identify inefficiencies in the execution of the BP, to predict outcomes possibly identifying problems and unexpected deviations from the process before they occur, and to provide data-driven insights for its optimization. A Business Process Digital Twin3 (BPDT) aligns with the generic DTs concept, where models integrated with real-time data undergo continuous analysis for improvements impacting the real world process. BPDTs involve rigorous what-if analysis through simulations and predictions [13]. These methods are employed to evaluate different scenarios, predict outcomes accurately, and strategically optimize and control the BP. By evaluating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of different what-if redesign processes, it is possible to identify areas for improvement and potential changes that are translated into actionable insights and interventions on the real-world process [13]. It is worth noticing that the BPDT can initiate a feedback loop wherein new data generated by the optimized BP is collected and analyzed to further enhance the process, establishing a continuous cycle of optimization [13,42]. This matches with the need to constantly maintain and update BPs to ensure that the real-world process remains efficient and effective over time [1]. 3 We adopt in this article the term Business Process Digital Twin as an alternative way of referring to a Digital Twin of a Business Process. Internet of Things 30 (2025) 101477 5 F. Fornari et al. 4. Open challenges & research directions The concept of a BPDT brings a set of challenges that must be addressed to realize its full potential. This section reports on such challenges and points out research gaps that should be addressed in future research. We summarized challenges and future directions in Table 1. C1-Design High-Fidelity Models. Gathering information about a process can be challenging and often requires multiple interactions with stakeholders, especially if the BP is less documented than the actual operations [29]. Usually, in the context of DTs, there might exist documentation that defines all aspects into models. Modeling BPs typically involves the engagement of domain experts and encompasses not just specific tasks but also events, activities, participants, interactions, and decisions [1]. This complexity makes it more difficult to verify the accuracy and fidelity of the models. The challenge lies in ensuring that the DT accurately replicates the BP, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the model by accurately representing all its components and interactions [29,43,44]. This becomes challenging especially in the context of unstructured processes where the lack of predefined steps or standardized procedures could further generate ambiguity [45] and difficulties in modeling [46]. In addressing the challenge of designing high-fidelity models for BPDTs, future research should focus on several key areas. Firstly, the development and enhancement of tools and methodologies for harvesting real-time data are crucial. Innovative approaches to data collection, particularly through IoT devices, should be explored to harvest contextual real-time information about the processes and participants involved [47]. Another promising direction involves utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract process- relevant information from extensive organizational documents, thus bridging the gap between static documentation and dynamic process modeling [48]. Additionally, advancing event abstraction techniques will help managing the complexity of unstructured processes by providing clearer representations of activities and interactions. Recently, it has been suggested to treat activity recommendation as a knowledge graph completion task and to apply methods from this discipline [49]. Leveraging process mining techniques can significantly aid in discovering and designing BP digital models that are more faithful to reality [22]. We can rely on event logs of actual processes to discover the BP model of interest by applying available software tools [50]. Recently a new paradigm in terms of event log has been introduced which focuses on recording the interactions between multiple objects within a BP. Such logs are referred as OCELs (Object-Centric Event Logs) [51]. OCEL\u2019s multi-object perspective allows for identifying complex dependencies and interactions often missed by traditional event logs. In addition, DTs often rely on a combination of models to capture multiple perspectives of the physical entity [52,53]. With respect to BPs, a full transition towards a BPDT should rely on the combination of multiple models and logs that describe different aspects of the real BP ultimately leading to more precise and high-fidelity models. Therefore the integration of multiple models in BPs context should be the focus of future research. C2- Real-time Synchronization of Data and Models. DTs strongly rely on data gathered from the physical world to reflect the status and operations of the physical counterpart in the digital space. In the context of BPs, event logs might not be immediately available, leading to a temporal delay in the alignment of virtual models. IoT devices can be used to monitor process execution in real-time, providing timely and updated information [3,54,55]. However, data can be distributed across different systems that use different sampling rates, different data formats, and different protocols to exchange data [56]. Ensuring timely and accurate synchronization of data across these distributed and heterogeneous systems is crucial for maintaining the fidelity and relevance of the DT model [57,58]. Addressing the challenge of synchronizing data and models in the context of DTs for BPs necessitates further research. One primary area of focus should be the automation of data pipelines to support process mining services [57]. This involves developing mechanisms for real-time data acquisition and integration from IoT devices, ensuring that the gathered data is timely and consistent despite the heterogeneity of sources and formats. One possibility to approach this is to leverage the strengths of Complex Event Processing (CEP) to handle the granularity and temporal aspects of data efficiently [59,60]. Additionally, creating tools for synchronizing and visualizing multiple perspectives of BPs will be essential for maintaining a holistic and coherent view of the process states. C3-Ensuring Data Reliability. Data should faithfully represent reality. In a BP context, data collected from the real world is used for modeling and simulating BPs to obtain indications on possible interventions [2,23]. On the one hand, if the recording of real process-executed activities is manually conducted, that might lead to erroneous or delayed activity registrations. On the other hand, IT systems that might be used to automatize such task can as well be subject to failure, especially in contexts where IoT devices are being adopted [55,61]. Acknowledging the possibility of hardware or software failures that could lead to the generation of faulty data is necessary, and countermeasures should be taken [61\u201363]. There is a need to focus on the system security of Process-Aware Information Systems (PAIS). On the one hand, conducting systematic reviews of how manual operations are conducted and possibly integrating Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can automate error-prone activities, reducing the likelihood of manual data entry errors [3]. On the other hand, developing and adopting robust security frameworks will mitigate risks associated with hardware and software failures, ensuring the integrity of the collected data. The adoption of tamper-proof mechanism should be advocated such as the adoption of the blockchain technology [64]. In the BP context the integration with blockchain technology has already been discussed [65] and gathers its own challenges and research directions. C4-Performing Valid Simulations. Business Process Simulation (BPS) is a technique used to quantitatively evaluate and optimize BPs [1,23]. It involves building a business process simulation model of a process, incorporating key input parameters such as the number of process instances to simulate or the estimated duration of individual tasks. BPS plays a key role in what-if process analysis, enabling the estimation of process performance metrics considering changes, such as adding tasks, altering decision Internet of Things 30 (2025) 101477 6 F. Fornari et al. Table 1 Challenges and research directions in the realization of the BPDT concept. Challenges Descriptions Research directions C1: Design high-fidelity models BPs typically involve multiple participants and source of information. This complexity makes it more difficult to design and align BP models with reality. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adopted to extract process-relevant information from extensive organizational documents. IoT devices should be integrated to capture for real-time data about processes and participants. Process Mining should be applied to automatize model discovery. C2: Real-time synchronization of data and models Process data and event logs may not be immediately available, resulting in a time delay in the alignment of virtual models. Data may be in different formats and distributed across different heterogeneous systems challenging retrieval operations. Foster the integration of IoT devices to perform real-time data acquisition. Handle the granularity and temporal aspects of data efficiently. Investigate the automation of data pipelines to support process mining services. C3: Ensuring data reliability Manual recording of real process-executed activities may result in inaccurate data, whereas IT systems or IoT devices may be subject to failure leading to the recording of erroneous data. Enhance security of Process-Aware Information Systems (PAIS). Apply Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to manual error-prone activities. Investigate and adopt tamper-proof mechanism such as blockchain. C4: Performing valid simulations The multi-perspectives nature of BPs, encompassing organizational structures, information systems, and human interactions makes it challenging to accurately replicate and simulate interventions in BP models. Traditional simulation methods often rely on manually designed models, which fail to capture the dynamic and stochastic aspects of BPs. Investigate multi-modeling approaches to effectively handle the complexity of business processes, leverage data-driven simulations and real-time data to create dynamic and context-aware environments, and integrate machine learning and causal analytics techniques to enhance the accuracy of simulations and support more informed decision-making. C5: Performing process predictions Predictions of real-world BPs involve multiple entities to be considered, increasing the level of complexity. Predicted outcomes of black-box approaches are not trusted. Enriching predictive and prescriptive process monitoring to improve the integration of AI-based techniques and data-driven approaches with an attention on the explainability of resulting predictions and prescriptions. C6: Actuating the intervention The lack of a proper infrastructure and the adoption of different communication protocols with different computational capabilities hinders the automatizing of interventions. The is a lack of proper documentation to guide user in performing intervention. Deploy IoT devices and proper infrastructures to support BPs. Adopt standardized communication protocols to improve the streamline of the interventions. Investigate LLMs to facilitate better understanding and acceptance of the to be actuated intervention. C7: Dealing with the human factor Dealing with the variability of human behavior throughout the entire process lifecycle, makes it difficult to define a BPDT with a high level of fidelity. Investigate the concept of Human Digital Twins to capture the nuances of human actors within BPs. Apply and evaluate ML and DL algorithms to predict human actions under different scenarios. Empower the role of humans in the loop by investigating on the integrate of human intelligence for defining resilient DTs and by developing ethical frameworks. C8: Dealing with new situations Unforeseen situations in BPs make it difficult to understand their status and how they will evolve. This raises the question of whether to adjust an existing models or discover new ones through process mining. Investigate the application of continuous process mining to identify new patterns and anomalies as they emerge in process execution. Investigate the concept of living model w.r.t. BPDT together with mechanisms to perform model adjustments and repairs. C9: Digital twins as process participants Considering DTs as participants in BPs is still an emerging topic and standardization approaches for their integration have not yet been fully defined. Define standardized frameworks and protocols to integrate DTs as BP participants. Use of DT repositories to facilitate the management and retrieval of DTs and promote their reusability within BPs. C10: Business process prototyping Prototyping BPs is not a common practice and requires comprehensive and detailed representation of multiple BP perspectives to effectively enable a digital-first approach in the case of BPs. BP prototyping before actually implementing the BP should be investigated and evaluated in practice. Tool for virtual process design should be enriched to provide mechanism to simulate BPs in a virtual environment before their actual implementation, enabling detailed analysis and optimization. C11: Software tools for digital twins of business processes Existing tools offer robust features for traditional BP management but they lack in addressing a fully integration of DT related concepts. Tools explicitly designed for DTs of BPs to support real-time data processing are needed. The integration of advanced AI-powered simulation capabilities should be investigated. C12: From DT of business processes to DT of organizations Organizations have to deal with multiple and interconnected BPs, departmental interactions, multiple and possibly shared resources, therefore realizing a DT of an organization inherits such a complexity. Investigate the systematic integration of DTs at the organization level. Explore digital tools aided with AI to support advanced analysis for DTOs. Enforce data standardization and communication protocols to facilitate interoperability and transparency within the organization. Internet of Things 30 (2025) 101477 7 F. Fornari et al. logic at branching points, or deploying additional resources. By anticipating the outcomes of interventions before their real-world implementation, organizations can make informed decisions and mitigate risks [14]. A BPDT, should not only replicate the as- is process but also enable the virtual introduction and simulation of process changes. This capability allows for the evaluation of intervention impacts by reasoning about a set of to-be BPs [13]. Nevertheless, the execution of such simulations and the precise estimation of process changes have always posed a challenge in the field of BPM [1,2,23]. BPs encompass different perspectives, including organizational structures, information systems, human interactions, and regulatory requirements [66]. Effectively considering these perspectives in BPS requires advanced modeling and analysis techniques to differentiate between predictable patterns and stochastic variations [67]. To conduct fair simulations that can inform decisions that affect the actual process, the BPDT must, therefore, accurately and faithfully replicate their real-world counterparts. A possible solution to cover the limits of inaccurate BPS models is the Data-Driven Process Simulation [42,68]. Data-Driven Process Simulation offers a solution by leveraging real data to discover and model more accurate simulation-ready models [68]. Unlike traditional BPS, which rely on manually gathered and interpreted information, Data-Driven Process Simulations leverage historical data, such as event logs, or data from contextual data models (i.e., finite state machines, and UML diagrams). Historical data is extracted from past event logs using process mining techniques and utilized as input parameters for BPSs. This approach leverages real data to create simulation models that accurately reflect and align with real-world processes [23,68]. In addition, simulation models can also be enhanced by integrating dynamic data models that provide contextual information about the entities involved in the process. This data, integrated with a simulation model, allows to answer important business questions, such as: \u2018\u2018What delays might occur if a critical machine suddenly fails?\u2019\u2019 This approach allows to evolve simulation models into proactive decision- making tools by predicting more accurate simulation outcomes. Additionally, combining Data-Driven Simulation with machine learning and deep learning techniques presents another promising direction. Recent work has shown that causal ML techniques can assess the impact of interventions on case outcomes [13] and that the machine learning model can improve the quality of input parameters of the simulation [69]. C5-Performing Process Predictions. DTs are used to predict future behavior and performance of the physical entity [12,16]. Such predictions provide useful information to guide the optimization of the physical entity before it is implemented at design time. At run-time, it allows to predict adverse events, such as bottlenecks, that would occur if the entity continued on its current course and suggests taking remedial actions to prevent those issues. DTs are in fact adopted for performing predictive maintenance operations [70]. Leveraging the possibility to perform BP predictions is regarded as challenging given that we are not limiting our scope to a single physical object for which a DT is produced, like is often done in the manufacturing sector [12,71], but a BP involves several entities, systems, human actors, and interactions among them raising the level of complexity in performing BP predictions. In the BP context, several approaches for conducting process predictions have been developed in recent years in the context of predictive and prescriptive process monitoring [57,72\u201375]. Those approaches often rely on so called \u2018\u2018black-box\u2019\u2019 techniques such as the use of neural networks and this hinders the application of prediction models in real-life scenarios because decision-makers do not trust predictions provided as-is with no further explanation [75]. Therefore, an increasing attention has been paid to ensuring that the resulting predictive monitoring system is workable in practice by fostering explainability of the predictions [76\u201381]. However, the proposed techniques are still rare in practice [82] and further research should be conducted on applying them and documenting successful cases. C6-Actuating the Intervention. DTs allow for bidirectional communication between the digital and the physical space. In the BP context, the communication from the digital to the physical space is represented by the feedback resulting from the process optimizations [41]. Such feedback needs to be promptly delivered to operators that conduct interventions, as well as other kinds of participants such as legacy applications, modern enterprise solutions, IoT devices, services, and the DTTs. Deploying an infrastructure able to process such automatized intervention and process execution is not a trivial task, considering that the various process participants might have different communication protocols or computational capabilities. To effectively actuate interventions based on a BPDT, future research should focus on developing robust infrastructures that facilitate seamless bidirectional communication between digital and physical spaces [83,84]. This involves creating sophisticated communication mechanisms that can guide automatic control systems, enabling them to execute interventions in real-time accurately [85]. It is therefore essential to adopt standardized communication protocols and enhance the computational capabilities of the various process participants, including legacy systems, modern enterprise solutions, IoT devices and other DT components. Moreover, research should explore mechanism to foster explainability of the proposed intervention. The use of advanced reporting tools, possibly leveraging LLMs, to generate comprehensive reports on the optimized versions of processes should be investigated. These reports could highlight the differences between the current and optimized processes, providing clear and actionable insights for business analysts. This will not only facilitate better understanding and acceptance of the changes but also enhance decision-making processes. C7-Dealing with the Human Factor. Human behavior exhibits a high degree of variability [3,13,86]. The more a system incorporates human factors, the more complex it becomes to define DTs with a high level of fidelity due to the difficulty of representing the variability of humans in terms of experience, behavior, fatigue, and reactions to the situations, which can impact the process [3,23,87]. Modeling such processes is a challenging endeavor that a BPDT should be capable of, providing faithful simulation mechanisms that account for the human factor to properly simulate [13,23]. The human factor not only affects the design of models and the simulation of processes, it also affects the enactment of process optimization, which can become challenging due to the variability in human behavior and the unpredictable nature of humans\u2019 reactions to interventions. Preserving the importance of humans in the loop in the enactment phase and balancing automation mechanisms expected from the DT becomes even more important, especially with the technological advancements that promise to automate most of the process activities [3,88]. Internet of Things 30 (2025) 101477 8 F. Fornari et al. Future research should prioritize the development of advanced models that can accurately represent the variability in human behavior, experience, fatigue, and reactions [13,87]. In literature, researchers started to refer to the concept of Human Digital Twin [89] to faithfully represent aspects of a human actor. However, it is essential to delineate the extent to which DTs can realistically and ethically represent human aspects without oversimplifying or misinterpreting their contributions. Furthermore, research should focus on enhancing simulation mechanisms to account for human variability, ensuring that simulations reflect realistic human interactions and responses. This can be achieved by integrating behavioral data and leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict human actions under different scenarios [13]. DTs must demonstrate resilience and avoid erroneous decisions when confronted with novel situations. Integrating human intelligence in the loop could be one way to foster resilience [11]. Additionally, ethical considerations must be at the forefront of this research. Ensuring the dignity and autonomy of human participants in BPs is paramount. Investigating frameworks that uphold human ethics while integrating DTs will help navigate the challenges associated with the human factor. By addressing these research directions, the integration of human elements into DTs can be significantly improved, leading to more robust, ethical, and effective BP models. C8-Dealing with New Situations. In the complex landscape of modern business, a company\u2019s success increasingly depends on its ability to respond quickly and flexibly to changes in its environment and the emergence of new situations [66]. However, dealing with new situations can be particularly challenging [3,13]. Often, the unpredictability arises because similar situations have not been observed before, leaving a gap in understanding how the process actors will respond [14,86]. In such cases, making accurate predictions becomes difficult [13]. DTs are envisioned with the capability of being able to spot new situations and adjust their digital models to properly reflect the newly encountered real situation and the new real state. This capability is often referred to with the concept Living Model [90]. How to reflect this living model concept into BPs is not yet fully clear, leaving open the question of whether to adjust a model with possible repair mechanisms [91], discover a model from scratch, or adopt a sort of continuous process mining approach [92]. In light of this, a possible solution is the implementation of continuous process mining to enable real-time data analysis. This approach involves constantly analyzing data streams to identify new patterns and anomalies as they emerge. By doing so, DTs can more accurately reflect new real-world situations, ensuring that models remain up-to-date and relevant. Additionally, research should focus on developing automated model adjustment and repair mechanisms. These mechanisms would allow for the dynamic adjustment of existing models in response to new data, maintaining their accuracy and usefulness without requiring a complete model overhaul. This aligns with the concept of the Living Model, where DTs continuously evolve to mirror real-world changes. Exploring the balance between adjusting existing models, discovering new models from scratch, and adopting continuous process mining approaches is essential. Each of these strategies offers unique benefits and challenges, and their integration could lead to more robust and flexible BPs. Furthermore, ensuring an exit-free mechanism for handling faulty process execution is vital. This involves creating systems that can detect and respond to real-time process failures, preventing disruptions and maintaining operational continuity [54,85]. C9-Digital Twins as Process Participants. Process participants could refer to human actors or things (e.g., devices, machineries, robots, etc.) that are involved in process related activities. Having DTs of participants could help in conducting simulations of the entire process without having to rely on the physical counterparts. DTs can be the target of requests to perform process actions as active participants. Furthermore, linking DTs of process participants can create a comprehensive view of the overall process, enhancing the accuracy and utility of simulations. This integrated approach can provide deeper insights into the interactions and dependencies within BPs, facilitating more informed decision-making and process improvements. For what concerns human participants and digital twins, a concept of Human digital twins (HDTs) is being investigated by some research works. HDTs comprise humans as a central component to transform business operations, enhance modeling capabilities, and improve safety and security [93]. HDTs are also being developed to model mental well-being in knowledge workers, addressing challenges related to stress and cognitive demands [94]. However, building accurate HDTs remains challenging due to the need for individualized representation of human characteristics. For what concerns Digital Twins of Things (DTTs), their role has been to some extend already explored by the available literature. DTTs offer clear advantages when they participate in BP activities [44,95]. By replacing direct communication with the real counterpart, DTTs can provide more reliable data and information during process execution as well as enhance process simulations. In the manufacturing context the ISO232474 series provides a comprehensive DT framework, offering a robust foundation for the implementation of DTTs. To effectively incorporate DTTs as active participants in BPs, future research should focus on developing further standardized frameworks and protocols for their integration. Research should also focus on developing dedicated repositories for DTs, facilitating the efficient storage, management, and retrieval of DTs for specific assets. By establishing such repositories, DTs of the same entities can be reused in different contexts without the need for recreating them from scratch. This reuse capability enhances the role of DTs as reliable process participants, providing timely and accurate information during process execution and simulations. C10-Business Process Prototyping. In the context of DTTs, it is common to first create the digital model and then implement the physical asset based on the model, allowing for simulation, analysis, and performance optimization before physical implemen- tation [16,96]. This digital-first approach reduces the risks associated with creating new things by identifying and correcting errors early on and promotes rapid iteration, enabling faster and more flexible development cycles. In contrast to using process discovery 4 https://www.iso.org/standard/75066.html. Internet of Things 30 (2025) 101477 9 F. Fornari et al. techniques on already existing processes, which is the standard practice in BPM, it seems reasonable to evaluate the introduction of this prototyping practice for BPs. By utilizing virtual process design, digital tools can simulate BPs in a virtual environment before their actual implementation [29]. This enables detailed analysis and optimization, allowing businesses to explore various scenarios and configurations to determine the most effective process designs. The challenge lies in the nature of BPs and the complexity involved in handling human interactions, regulatory constraints, and varying operational contexts. A comprehensive and detailed representation of these aspects is necessary to effectively enable a digital-first approach in the case of BPs. Attempt to perform BP prototyping before actually implementing the BP should be investigated and evaluated in practice. Tool for virtual process design should be enriched to provide mechanism to simulate BPs in a virtual environment before their actual implementation, enabling detailed analysis and optimization. C11-Software Tools for Digital Twins of Business Processes. DTs for BPs require a more integrated approach, capable of real- time data assimilation, continuous process optimization, and predictive analytics. Existing tools are not specifically designed with these advanced capabilities in mind, leading to limitations in their application to DTs [7]. Current implementations often rely on pre-existing BP modeling tools, such as Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) [42,97,98] or comprehensive software suites like Bizagi modeler, BonitaSoft, CAMUNDA, Visual Paradigm, Process Simulator [97] and BPM ELMA [99]. While these tools offer robust features for traditional BP management, they fall short in addressing the dynamic, real-time requirements that DTs need. Well-known process mining tools such as Apromore [100], Celonis, SAP Signavio, started to integrate the concept of DT to support simulation and improvement of business operations, but in different ways and a standardized approach is still needed. As a result, the lack of standardized frameworks and platforms that could serve as the basis for DTs of BPs forces researchers to start from scratch or rely on fragmented solutions that are tailored to the needs of DTs [101]. There is a pressing need for the development of specialized tools designed explicitly for DTs in BPs. These tools should incorporate real-time data processing, advanced simulation capabilities, and seamless integration with IoT devices and enterprise systems. Additionally, exploring the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning within these tools could enhance their ability to predict process outcomes and suggest optimizations automatically. C12-From Digital Twin of Business Processes to Digital Twin of Organizations. The concept of DT has recently been extended beyond physical assets to encompass entire organizations. This transition, referred to as Digital Twins of Organizations (DTOs), involves applying the principles of the DT paradigm to organizations [29]. DTOs promise to enable the analysis, monitoring, simulation, and optimization of organizational operations to facilitate strategic planning, enhance decision-making, and improve overall organizational efficiency [102]. However, in the context of a DTO, the complexity extends beyond that of a conventional DTT or BPDT. A DTO mirrors not just a single product or system but a set of BPs, departmental interactions, workflows, and operational dynamics [29]. This creates scenarios where changes made to a singular process (e.g., improving the workflow\u2019s structure) can significantly affect other interconnected organizational processes. If not managed properly, this can result in cascading errors and ambiguities affecting other organizational processes. Managing this complexity and identifying effective tools is challenging. First of all, creating DTOs requires demands a deep understanding of organizational dynamics and stakeholder interactions [39]. In light of this, effective collaboration between technical and organizational design experts is fundamental [61]. Additionally, intuitive user interfaces and advanced analysis tools are critical for visualizing and optimizing organizational processes [62], especially in contexts where organizations rely on heterogeneous data sourced from diverse systems and models. Establishing common standards for data representation, supported by AI-driven techniques for data analysis and visualization, enhances DTO reasoning capabilities. This approach not only improves the clarity and impact of analyses but also fosters more effective decision-making processes within the organization [61,62]. 5. Concluding remarks The integration of DTs and BPs is opening many opportunities and promises to revolutionize the way we deal with BPs. Domains in which such an integration started to be adopted are vary. In the manufacturing sector DTs enable the real-time tracking and monitoring of production processes, aiming to save time, reduce costs, and anticipate failures [103]. In supply chain management, the integration of DTs and BPs enable real-time modeling and optimization of supply chain processes, improving operational efficiency and responsiveness [104]. In healthcare, DTs and BPs support the simulation and analysis of healthcare workflows, optimizing patient care delivery and resource allocation while reducing risks [105]. In smart cities, integrating DTs and BPs facilitate better planning and management of urban processes, such as traffic flow and energy distribution, enhancing sustainability and efficiency. Companies around the world are integrating DTs in their processes. DHL creates digital twins of their warehouse operations for process optimization [106]. Siemens uses DTs to create digital twins of manufacturing processes [107]. Volkswagen, has integrated digital twins into its supply chain to optimize efficiency and proactively adjust its production schedules and inventory levels [108]. Leading process innovation companies such as Apromore, Celonis, and SAP Signavio, also recognize the commercial value of DT in BPs [109,110] and started providing solutions to support them. With this work, we reported on the results of a joined effort of a group of twenty-three academics, ranging from experienced professors to young researchers from different academic and research institutions, enthusiastic about the technological advancements and perspectives that the integration of DT and BP concepts can lead to. We specifically provide a way to look at such integration, laying the foundation for a common vision on the topic. We clarified on the usage of the terms Business Process Model, Business Process Digital Shadow, and Business Process Digital Twin. To reach a full transition to a Business Process Digital Twin different Internet of Things 30 (2025) 101477 10 F. Fornari et al. challenges must be addressed. We identified twelve of such challenges that we summarized in Table 1 and we encourage researchers to address them by providing pointers to future research directions. Furthermore, while analyzing the literature for this work we noticed a significant difference in the maturity levels of DTs. DTs of things are highly advanced, with extensive research and practical applications demonstrating their efficacy [111]. In contrast, DTs of BPs are less mature due to the complexity involved in integrating multiple stages of a process, from data collection to process mining and workflow mapping and despite research work on the topic is increasing [39,112\u2013114] actual applications and documented cases are required to demonstrate the applicability in practice. We want to encourage researchers in pursuing the realization of BPDTs. A lot of research efforts have already been made in the field of BP management, and several approaches that have been defined to deal with the digitization of BPs can find a place to contribute to the realization of this BPDT concept. All that is required is a proper combination, tuning and adoption in real BP scenarios. Instead, DTOs represent an even newer and more complex frontier, aiming to encompass all aspects of an organization. This requires the integration of diverse data sources, subsystems, and human factors, making this kind of DT the least mature among the three types and posing significant challenges for effective implementation [46,61,115]. In addition, DTs can be applied further beyond the boundary of an organization, reaching for instance the concept of DT of whole cities [116\u2013118], making the DT application inevitably more challenging as the complexity of the target physical entity under consideration increases. Finally, integration of multiple levels of DTs is crucial for achieving a seamless and effective digital representation of complex scenarios. This poses additional challenges on which to direct further research efforts.

Architectural patterns have been recently specified in the litera- ture to showcase reusable solutions to common problems within Federated Learning systems. However, patterns often lead to both benefits and drawbacks, e.g., introducing a message compressor algorithm may reduce the system communication time, but it may produce additional computational costs for clients\u2019 devices. The goal of this paper is to quantitatively investigate the performance impact of applying a selected set of architectural patterns when designing Federated Learning systems, thus providing evidence of their pros and cons. We develop an open source environment by extending the well-established Flower framework; it integrates the implementation of four architectural patterns and evaluates their performance characteristics. Experimental results assess that architectural patterns indeed bring performance gains and pains, as raised by the practitioners in the literature. Our framework can support software architects in making informed design choices when designing Federated Learning systems. Index Terms\u2014Architectural Patterns, Federated Learning, Performance Evaluation I. I NTRODUCTION Federated Learning (FL) systems are increasingly attract- ing attention from both researchers and practitioners [1]\u2013[3], mainly due to their peculiar characteristic of distributing the learning to multiple clients, thus reducing data privacy risks and computational costs encountered by traditional centralized methods [4], [5]. According to Gartner\u2019s 2023 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies [6], Federated Learning (FL) has the potential to revolutionize machine learning applications by enabling collaborative model training across distributed data sources without the need to share sensitive data. Recent studies on FL [7], [8] lists performance optimization as one of the main challenges in this domain. Computational overhead may be introduced for different reasons: (i) preventing pri- vate data from being leaked during model transmission; (ii) guaranteeing high communication efficiency; (iii) tolerating heterogeneous hardware resources and handling fault tolerance in case of offline devices; (iv) verifying the accuracy of local models. All these scenarios motivate the need to instrument FL systems and enable their performance evaluation [9], thus understanding when performance issues may arise. In the software architecture community, designing FL sys- tems is recognized as an emergent topic, and a reference architecture, namely FLRA, has been recently defined in [2]. A follow-up work from the same authors is presented in [10] where a collection of architectural patterns is derived from a systematic literature review, and the design challenges of FL systems are presented. Notably, applying architectural patterns triggers both benefits and drawbacks for the system performance. For instance, the Client Selector pattern [10] consists of selecting clients with more power and network bandwidth, thus reducing the chances of clients dropping out and lowering the communication latency. This entails the introduction of a Client Registry pattern [10] that is in charge of storing information about the client devices, but the maintenance of this information requires extra communication and storage costs, which is further affected by the number of client devices [10]. Inspired by these challenges, our research focuses on developing a framework that enables the perfor- mance analysis of FL architectural patterns, thus supporting software architects in making informed decisions. To the best of our knowledge, the most closely related state- of-the-art approaches to architecting FL systems are [9], [11]. Di Martino et al. [11] investigate the quantitative impact of architectural patterns applied to the design of Cloud Edge architectures within the healthcare domain. Lai et al. [9] pro- pose a benchmark to emulate FL environments while offering application programming interfaces (APIs) to implement, de- ploy, and evaluate FL algorithms. As opposite, this paper aims to quantitatively analyze the performance characteristics of some architectural patterns extracted from [10]. Specifically, we develop a novel framework, namely Architectural Patterns for Federated Learning AP4F ED, that builds upon the well- consolidated Flower [12], and hosts the implementation of these four selected architectural patterns: (i) the Client Registry that stores information on clients contributing to the training; (ii) the Client Selector that improves the system efficiency by selecting clients that show some preferred criteria, e.g., more computational power; (iii) the Client Cluster that en- hances the training efficiency by grouping clients based on their similarities; (iv) the Message Compressor that increases communication efficiency by reducing the message data size. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are: (i) the development of an FL framework hosting the implementation of four architectural patterns indicated relevant for the system performance in a recent literature review [10]; (ii) the design of experiments whose results support software architects in quantitatively understanding the impact of these architectural patterns on the performance of FL systems; (iii) the flexibility in changing the design settings for patterns, thus enabling further quantitative investigations. The developed framework and replication data are publicly available [13]. II. B ACKGROUND Federated Learning. The exponential growth of computing devices, now equipped with advanced sensors such as cameras, microphones, and GPS, has resulted in the generation of high amounts of data, much of which are often sensitive and highly personal [10], [14]. This vast amount of data has driven the development of machine learning applications, as it represents a valuable resource for training prediction models capturing complex patterns, and improving decision-making [7]. How- ever, while this data holds significant potential for machine learning applications, its sensitive nature raises serious privacy concerns, especially when shared with centralized servers or external organizations [1], [15]. FL is a paradigm introduced by Google in 2016 [14], in which multiple client devices (e.g., mobile phones and laptops) collaborate under the coordination of a central server to train a global machine learning model, while keeping their local data private [1], [7], [10]. It addresses data privacy by enabling machine learning model training directly on clients\u2019 devices, ensuring that personal data is locally stored. It also allows computation to be distributed across a network, improving scalability and reducing reliance on centralized processing resources [15]. Figure 1 provides an overview of the FL mechanism. A FL process starts when a central server broadcasts a set of initial global model parameters (i.e., model weights and structure) to all participating clients 1 . After receiving the parameters, model training is performed locally across the client devices 2 . Then, each participating client device sends its updated model parameters (i.e., trained model weights) to the central server 3 . The central server collects all trained models and aggregates them to generate an updated \u201cversion\u201d of the global model 4 . New parameters of the global model are then distributed to the client devices for the next FL round. This establishes an iterative process for continuously updating and improving the global model until it converges. Developing FL systems is far from trivial, as it requires robust coordination among system parties (i.e., clients and the central server), overcoming challenges on device heterogene- ity, and scalability across networks [14], [15]. To effectively manage this complexity, Flower [12] has emerged as a leading framework for supporting and simplifying the deployment of FL systems. Flower offers a standardized implementation of essential FL components, along with high-level abstractions that enable researchers and practitioners to explore and imple- ment new functionalities [12]. For all these reasons, we make use of Flower as the reference framework to implement and evaluate the performance of FL architectural patterns.

We consider all those patterns that are relevant for system efficiency [10]. We exclude the patterns that contribute to other aspects of FL systems, e.g., the so- called Model Aggregation patterns include design solutions of model aggregation used for different purposes. The detailed description of selected patterns is provided in [10], in the following, we briefly outline their main characteristics: i. The Client Registry manages and provides information about all clients participating in the training process; ii. The Client Selector samples client devices during the training according to some predefined criteria to increase the system efficiency; iii. The Client Cluster groups client devices to improve the training efficiency; iv. The Message Compressor reduces the message data size to increase the communication efficiency. III. M ETHODOLOGY Our methodology consists of developing a novel FL frame- work, namely AP4F ED [13], that hosts the implementation of selected patterns and enables their evaluation. We leverage Flower [12], and architectural patterns are implemented by extending its codebase Python library. It is worth remarking that software architects can use AP4F ED by following our detailed instructions (please refer to [13]), i.e., modifying input parameter values and conducting further investigations. A. AP4F ED Infrastructure The overview of the developed environment is depicted in Figure 2. This setup uses Docker-Compose to create a configuration with one container representing the central server \u2026 Client n Client 1 Server Fig. 2: AP4F ED Infrastructure overview. and multiple containers acting as client devices. This envi- ronment simulates a real-world FL scenario, where isolated Docker containers represent a network of clients performing local training, and a central server container handles model aggregation. Our framework extends the Flower Python library version 1.12.0 [12]. Flower provides a set of methods to enable the communication between the server and all clients, handling key aspects such as client-server message exchange, model updates, and round-based coordination. We use PyTorch version 2.5.0 [16] for model training, allowing each client to train on local data. Table I collects the input parameters to set up the environment, i.e., the number of FL rounds (NUM_ROUNDS), instances of server and client containers ( nS and nC, respectively), and the allocation of resources per container, specifically the number of physical CPUs ( n_CPU) and the RAM capacity. Note that, these parameters may in- tentionally vary depending on the experimental setup, which is determined by the architectural pattern under investigation. For instance, the Client Selector pattern selects client devices depending on their available resources, hence we decide to set up clients with a different number of allocated CPU(s). B. Client Registry Architectural Pattern Server Client Registry Client Device Information Client Client Client Fig. 3: Client Registry pattern overview. Context. The Client Registry pattern is designed to store relevant information of each client device participating in an FL process [10]. As illustrated in Figure 3, the central server maintains a centralized data registry for storing client device Parameter Description cID Client Unique Identifier n_CPU no. of Container CPU cluster_Type Cluster associated to the Client training_time Client Training Time communication_time Client Communication Time total_round_time Client Total Round Time TABLE II: Extended parameters for Client Registry. data. At the beginning of each round, the server sends a request to each client, that responds with a set of attributes including device ID, connection uptime and downtime, and resource availability (e.g., computational power, communication capac- ity, and storage). This architectural pattern plays a key role in ensuring efficient client management, enabling the server to monitor all connected devices and gather useful insights, such as identifying clients that are actively participating, have disconnected, or exhibit untrustworthy behavior [10]. Our Implementation. This architectural pattern is already partly implemented in Flower through the ClientManager1 abstract base class. This class enables the Client Registry to track each client\u2019s information and interactions with the server. However, relevant parameters regarding the client performance (i.e., number of CPUs) or the device system metrics (i.e., training or communication time) are missing. Such attributes provide key information that can be lever- aged to exploit new features, such as dynamic client se- lection based on resource availability or prioritizing clients with higher stability for critical rounds. For this reason, we extend the standard ClientManager class to implement additional parameters. Table II lists the added parameters. We consider a unique client identifier ( cID), that is gener- ated when each client is instantiated. This identifier helps to distinguish clients within the system. The n_CPU pa- rameter, which indicates the number of CPUs assigned to each container. The cluster_Type parameter is a label reassigned at each round to group clients based on a pre- defined client clustering strategy (see Section III-D). Tim- ing parameters are collected using psutil, i.e., a Python library for retrieving system metrics. The training_time parameter records the time each client spends on the local model training. The communication_time measures the time required to exchange model parameters with the server. The total_round_time parameter represents the overall time each client takes to complete a round, combining both training and communication durations. C. Client Selector Architectural Pattern Context. The Client Selector pattern introduces a mechanism for selecting a subset of client devices to participate in the FL round according to specific criteria [10], [17]. Such criteria can be categorized as follows: (i) resource-based factors, which evaluate the computational and network capabilities of devices; (ii) data-based factors, which assess the quality, 1Additional information is available at https://flower.ai/docs/framework/ ref-api/flwr.server.ClientManager.html Server Client Client Client Fig. 4: Client Selector pattern overview. heterogeneity, and volume of the data each client holds; and (iii) performance-based factors, which assess each client\u2019s contributions to the global model enhancement based on their performance in the latest round [17]. Overall, this assessment involves evaluating resources, data quality, and performance metrics to determine if and which clients are best suited for contributing to the global model aggregation. As depicted in Figure 4, the server evaluates each client by analyzing the information stored in the Client Registry, to exclude or include clients based on selection criteria. Evaluating and selecting clients based on their characteristics may mitigate challenges associated with limited computational resources, unbalanced data distribution, and unstable client connectivity [10], [17]. Our Implementation. To implement the Client Selec- tor pattern, we apply a filtering procedure to the Flower configure_fit2 method, thus assessing the eligibility of client devices for the FL round. The configure_fit method sets the essential information (i.e., participating clients, model parameters) required to conduct the FL round. At the beginning of each round, the server accesses the Client Registry to review clients\u2019 information. Our current implementation considers the resource-based selection strat- egy [10], in which the server selects clients on the basis of their computational power, e.g., the number of allocated CPUs. This process ensures that only clients meeting specific criteria are chosen for each round, thus optimizing the FL process. D. Client Cluster Architectural Pattern Server Client Client Client Client Cluster A Cluster B Fig. 5: Client Cluster pattern overview. 2Additional information is available at https://flower.ai/docs/framework/ how-to-implement-strategies.html Context. The Client Cluster pattern groups client devices based on the similarity of their characteristics. They can be categorized as follows: (i) computational resources, referring to the device\u2019s processing power and memory capacity; (ii) network capabilities, i.e., the speed and stability of the device\u2019s network connection; and (iii) data partitioning , considering how data is distributed across devices [10]. The graphical representation of the Client Cluster architectural pattern is reported in Figure 5. The server uses the information from the Client Registry to group clients into distinct clusters based on their characteristics. By clustering clients with similar features, the server can apply tailored aggregation and training strategies. This is performed to enhance training efficiency by reducing training round time and increasing the model accuracy [10]. For instance, the server can address the data heterogeneity problem [18] by clustering clients based on data distribution, leading to improved model performance and faster convergence [7], [10]. Our Implementation. Similarly to the Client Selector pat- tern, we implement the Client Cluster mechanism through the configure_fit method. Clients are assigned to a cluster depending on their local data partitions, which may vary between independent and identically distributed (IID) and non- independent and identically distributed (non-IID) forms [18]. In IID data settings, each client has a balanced set of training samples representing all classes and ensuring that data are uniformly distributed. In contrast, non-IID data present an unbalanced distribution, meaning that some clients have more training examples of a specific class than others [7], [18]. E. Message Compressor Architectural Pattern Server Client Model Parameters (Compression) Local Model Trained (Compression) 1 2 34 Model Parameters (Decompression) Local Model Trained (Decompression) Fig. 6: Message Compressor pattern overview. Context. The Message Compressor pattern introduces a procedure to reduce the size of message data exchanged (e.g., model weight and structure) between the central server and client devices in an FL environment [10], [19]. As illustrated in Figure 6, this pattern operates on both ends of the system. Initially, the server compresses the model parameters 1 before sending them to client devices. The data is transmitted in a compressed format, hence reducing communication over- head. Upon receiving compressed parameters, client devices decompress the data 2 and prepare it for local training. After completing local training, client devices compress their updated model parameters 3 before transmission. Then, the server decompresses received messages 4 to aggregate all models. In FL, multiple rounds of model exchange occur between the server and client devices to collaboratively train the global model [15]. By minimizing the volume of data transmitted, the Message Compressor significantly decreases communication time and preserves bandwidth, which could be particularly beneficial for bandwidth-constrained client devices [10]. However, the time needed for compression and decompression can overcome the saving in communication time, especially when the exchanged data are low. Our Implementation. We implement the Message Compres- sor pattern by introducing a compression mechanism to opti- mize data exchanges between clients and the server. Specifi- cally, our approach embeds the zlib library [20] to implement two-stage compression and decompression (server-to-client and client-to-server), effectively reducing the overhead and improving the communication efficiency. zlib belongs to the LZ77 family of compression algorithms and is valued for its high-speed compression with minimal resource consumption, making it a good choice among available algorithms [21]. IV. E XPERIMENTS Subject Systems. We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a global model on the CIFAR-10 dataset [22], which consists of 60, 000 32x32 color images (50, 000 images for training and 10, 000 for testing) divided into 10 distinct classes. Each class includes images representing objects and animals (i.e., trucks, dogs), challenging the CNN to effectively recognize and classify images into one of the 10 classes. The main characteristics of the global model are reported in Table III. The CNN consists of two convolutional layers (Conv) with ReLU activations, followed by max-pooling layers (Pool) to reduce spatial dimensions. Specifically, the first convolutional layer (Conv1) has 6 filters with a 5x5 kernel, and the second convolutional layer (Conv2) has 16 filters with a 5x5 kernel. Each convolutional layer is followed by ReLU activation. The model then transitions to two fully connected layers (FC), where FC1 has 120 units, FC2 has 84 units, and the final layer (FC3) has 10 units corresponding to the classes of CIFAR-10. The model is trained with a batch size of 32, a learning rate of 0.001, and a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a momentum equal to 0.9. Hardware Setup. Experiments are conducted on a commod- ity machine with an Apple M3 Pro chip featuring an11-core CPU @4.02GHz and 36GB memory. Docker Compose en- ables the manual allocation of resources to each container (e.g., CPU core and RAM) allowing flexible experiment con- figurations tailored to the architectural pattern being evaluated. For instance, different CPU allocations are assigned to client containers to evaluate system performance when implementing the Client Selector pattern. This approach provides a scenario with computational disparity between clients to analyze how different resource allocations impact the system performance. It is worth remarking that the maximum number of concur- rently running containers is limited by the host machine\u2019s Parameter Value Dataset CIFAR-10 Training Samples 50, 000 Test Samples 10, 000 Model Type Convolutional Neural Network Model Structure Conv1: 6 filters, 5x5 kernel, ReLU activation Pool: Max pooling, 2x2 kernel Conv2: 16 filters, 5x5 kernel, ReLU activation FC1: 120 units, ReLU activation FC2: 84 units, ReLU activation FC3: 10 units (for CIFAR-10\u2019s 10 classes) Batch Size 32 Learning Rate 0.001 Optimizer SGD (momentum = 0.9) Conv: Convolutional Layer; Pool: Pooling Layer; FC: Fully Connected Layer.

This is crucial, as exceeding devices\u2019 processing limits can lead to resource contention, potentially invalidating the replicability of experimental results [23]. All experiments are repeated 10 times and reported results are the average of all outputs. The 99% confidence interval is represented by shaded areas in all graphs. Evaluation Metrics. Table IV lists metrics used in our ex- periments, as proposed in [24]. We evaluate key performance indicators, including training, communication, and total round times, as well as model accuracy using the F1 score [25]. These metrics provide round-by-round performance tracking, offering quantifiable insights into the trade-offs associated with the design solutions of architectural patterns. A. Performance Analysis: Client Selector Table V presents input parameters used for the Client Selector pattern experiment. We consider 10 training rounds, a single server, and 4 clients. To test the effectiveness of this pattern, clients are divided into High-Spec and Low-Spec categories based on their computational capacity. High-Spec clients are equipped with 2 CPUs, providing larger processing power, while Low-Spec clients have 1 CPU only, reflecting more limited computational capacity. Since we implement a resource-based selection strategy, we establish specific evalua- tion criteria requiring clients to have a physical CPU allocation greater than one to participate in each FL round. As reported in Table VI, we evaluate the performance of the Client Selector pattern through three different experiment configurations labeled A, B, and C. In each configuration, we keep an number of 4 Clients and 1 Server. Config. A includes 4 High-Spec clients without applying the Client Selector pattern. In Config. B, we introduce a Low-Spec client and 3 High- Spec ones, and we do not make use of the selection strategy. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Federated Learning Round 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6F1 Score Config. A Config.

Config. C follows the same setup as Config. B; however, we introduce the Client Selector to exclude the Low-Spec client, limiting the learning process to 3 High-Spec clients. Figure 7 depicts the performance analysis of an FL system implementing the Client Selector pattern. Starting from the global model accuracy, Figure 7a depicts the F1 Score evolu- tion across FL rounds for each experiment configuration. The results of all experiments indicate that, after 10 rounds, the accuracy ranges between 0.57 and 0.59, with stable model convergence. Figure 7b shows the total time required to complete an FL round for each configuration. Results indicate that Config. A and Config. C exhibit similar round time, with Config. C being slightly faster. This behavior is expected as Config. C, compared to Config. A and Config. B, excludes one client from the FL round, thus reducing the workload for model training and aggregation. Configuration B shows a high FL total round time, approximately 9\u00d7 longer than Config. C, due to the bottleneck introduced by the Low-Spec client. We aggregate accuracy and total round time to derive an efficiency metric, represented by the ratio of F1 Score and Total Round Time across rounds. Values assumed by this ratio are shown in Figure 7c, where we can notice that the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency is achieved by Config. C that is the one implementing the pattern. Config. A achieves moderate efficiency with some fluctuation across rounds. As expected, Config. B maintains the lowest efficiency ratio, reflecting the overhead introduced by the Low-Spec client in FL rounds. Architectural Implications. Software architects can employ this architectural pattern when there is a disparity among clients in terms of resource capabilities. Experimental results show that the system response time, expressed as the total round time in FL contexts [24], deteriorates when Low-Spec clients participate in FL rounds, thus leading to bottlenecks and high waiting time. B. Performance Analysis: Client Cluster Table VII reports input parameters used in the Client Cluster experiment. The setup involves 10 rounds of FL with 1 server and 8 clients with 1 CPU and 2GB of RAM. We implement the Client Cluster architectural pattern by adopting a data distribution-based strategy [10], thus creating two distinct clusters: Cluster A and Cluster B based on how client data is partitioned. Clients in Cluster A show an equal distribution of data samples across classes, representing IID data, while clients in Cluster B contain non-IID data. To partition the non-IID data for clients in Cluster B, we use the Dirichlet distribution [26]3, effectively replicating variations in data dis- tribution. This approach enables a realistic and accurate test of the Client Cluster pattern, effectively simulating typical real- world scenarios where non-IID datasets are common [15]. The Dirichlet Distribution is a multivariate probability distribution, commonly used in FL experiments [18], [27], allowing for non-IID data\u2019s partitions. For completeness, we report the Dirichlet distribution formula: p(x1, x2, . . . , xk) = 1 B(\u03b1) kY i=1 x\u03b1i\u22121 i p(x1, x2, . . . , xk) represents the probability density function of the Dirichlet distribution for k variables. The constant B(\u03b1), known as the beta function, normalizes the distribution, calculated based on the parameters \u03b1 = (\u03b11, \u03b12, . . . , \u03b1k) to ensure the total probability sums to one. The term Qk i=1 x\u03b1i\u22121 i represents the product of each variable xi raised to the power \u03b1i \u22121, capturing the non-uniformity in probability distribution 3https://flower.ai/docs/datasets/ref-api/flwr datasets.partitioner.

Here, \u03b1 defines the degree of imbalance, allowing adjustments to test varying levels of data non- uniformity in partitioning. The number of training examples in these experiments is reduced from 50, 000 to 25, 000 to allow a different distribution of non-IID data. This change is due to the CIFAR-10 dataset maximum number of samples being 5, 000 per class (across 10 classes). This way, we assign a different amount of samples across classes to Cluster B, ensuring fair and comparable experiment configurations. Figure 9a depicts the difference in data partitioning for Clusters A and B, highlighting the percentage of examples for each class. In Cluster A, each class in the CIFAR-10 dataset has 2, 500 training examples, while Cluster B displays a non-uniform distribution, such as 500 examples for dog and 4, 500 for ship classes, ensuring that the total number of training examples remains equal between the two clusters. Table VIII collects the three different analyzed configura- tions, i.e., 4a4b, 5a3b, and 6a2b. Each configuration label, such as 4a4b, represents the specific number of Clients A with IID data and Clients B with non-IID data (e.g., 4a4b means 4 Clients A and 4 Clients B). Each configuration is evaluated with and without applying the Client Cluster pattern. The clustering methodology generates two distinct global models: model A, trained with Clients A, and model B, trained with Clients B. This approach allows for a detailed analysis of how clustering influences the model performance across diverse data distributions. Non-clustered configurations remove the clustering component, leading all clients to collaborate on a single global model A, mixing IID and non-IID data. By progressively decreasing the proportion of non-IID clients (i.e., from 4a4b to 5a3b and 6a2b), this setup enables a compre- hensive assessment of how changes in the number of non-IID clients impact model training efficiency (i.e., better accuracy, TABLE VIII: Experiment configurations for Client Cluster.

This highlights the impact of the Client Cluster pattern in effectively managing heterogeneous data distributions across clients. Results of this experiment are shown in Figure 9, where we report the accuracy (F1 Score), the average training time, and the efficiency metric evaluated on the ratio between accuracy and training time. Figure 9a depicts the F1 Score of each global model against FL rounds. We can notice that all the configurations with clustering (represented by dashed lines), show an overall higher F1 Score (except for the first round), demonstrating improved model accuracy and faster conver- gence over FL rounds. In contrast, non-clustered configura- tions (solid lines) yield lower F1 Scores, showing low model accuracy and slower convergence across FL rounds. Figure 9b presents the clients average training time during FL rounds. Configurations using the Client Cluster pattern exhibit shorter and more stable training time across rounds, e.g., the 5a3b configuration (with cluster) shows an observed training time varying between 110 and 118 seconds across the ten rounds. In contrast, configurations without the Client Cluster pattern exhibit significantly higher and more variable training times. For example, the 5a3b configuration (without cluster) reaches peaks from 186 seconds in round 3 up to 263 seconds in round 8. This aligns with practitioners\u2019 expectations, confirming that training times can increase when rounds include clients with non-IID data [18], [27]. Figure 9c depicts the F1 Score against the average training time, providing a metric for assessing the system performance efficiency. As highlighted by the trends, clustered configurations exhibit a higher efficiency ratio. In contrast, values assumed by configurations without the Client Cluster pattern, show lower efficiency. Architectural Implications. Software architects may benefit from adopting this pattern in scenarios where clients exhibit high heterogeneity in their local data distribution, such as in the case of non-IID distributions. Experimental results indicate that using a clustering approach to group clients based on data partition characteristics accelerates global model convergence and reduces the average training time in FL systems. C. Performance Analysis: Message Compressor Table IX reports input parameters for the Message Compres- sor pattern experiment. This setup includes 10 FL rounds, with a single server and 8 clients, each one with 1 CPU and 2GB of RAM. This pattern implements a compression mechanism for exchanging global model data between clients and the central server, using version 1.3.1 of the zlib Python library [20] for both compression and decompression steps.

Here, n represents the global model size determined by the structure described in Section III. Each experiment is conducted with and without the Message Compressor pattern, thus contributing to assessing its impact. TABLE X: Experiment configurations of Message Compres- sor.

Figure 10 illustrates the results of the experiments. For each configuration, we depict the average communication time. The shaded areas capture the reduction or the increasing in the estimated time, in plain or framed colored areas, respectively. This enables a direct comparison of performance with and without the Message Compressor architectural pattern, facili- tating an assessment of its impact using the same model size. Figure 10a shows the communication time obtained with the n/2 configuration. In this case, we can observe an increase in communication time when the pattern is used, suggesting a possible overhead introduced by the compression and decom- pression process. Figure 10b shows the communication time for model size n. From round 4 onward, using compression slightly reduces communication time, showing a marginal benefit compared to the previous experiment. Figure 10c shows the results for the n \u2217 2 configuration. Applying the pattern here results in a reduction in communication time across all rounds, suggesting higher gains in terms of reducing communication time when applying compression to larger models. In Figure 10d, we compare the relative improvement in communication time across the three configurations. To quantify this impact, we calculate the relative improvement in communication time by comparing configurations with and without compression. The formula is as follows: Improvement (%) = \u0012Tno compression \u2212 Tcompression Tno compression \u0013 \u00d7 100 Here, Tno compression represents the average communication time for clients without compression, while Tcompression indi- cates the average communication time for clients with the compression mechanism being applied. The formula provides a metric for improvement, i.e., the percentage reduction in communication time achieved through compression. Positive values indicate a reduction in communication time, while negative values reflect an increase. For the smaller model size ( n/2), enabling the Message Compressor pattern results in a negative impact on communication time, indicating that compression may be less effective or counterproductive with smaller models. The experiment with model size set to n ini- tially shows a negative impact during the first rounds, it turns to an improvement in later rounds. In contrast, the larger model size (n\u22172) consistently shows improvement in communication time across all rounds, indicating that the Message Compressor is particularly effective for larger models. Architectural Implications. Software architects can consider this architectural pattern when managing large global models. Experimental results indicate that, as the global model size grows, implementing compression becomes increasingly rele- vant, leading to a significant reduction in communication time that improves the overall system latency. V. D ISCUSSION A. Limitations on Architectural Patterns Client Registry. This pattern is fundamental in our work to implement other architectural patterns we consider within FL. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Federated Learning Round 350 400 450 500 550Communication Time (sec) Positive Impact Negative Impact With Compression Without Compression (a) Communication Time for n/2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Federated Learning Round 400 450 500 550 600Communication Time (sec) Positive Impact Negative Impact With Compression Without Compression (b) Communication Time for n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Federated Learning Round 350 400 450 500 550 600 650Communication Time (sec) Positive Impact Negative Impact With Compression Without Compression (c) Communication Time for n\u00d72 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Federated Learning Round -40 -20 0 20Improvement (%) Config. n/2 Config. n Config. n*2 (d) Configurations Comparison Fig. 10: Performance analysis of the Message Compressor pattern. It is assessed to enhance both maintainability and reliability in FL systems by centralizing client devices\u2019 information [10]. However, centralizing sensitive client data on the server can lead to privacy and security risks in case of malicious at- tacks [10]. As future work, we can mitigate these risks, e.g., an SSL/TLS authentication system can ensure secure communication between clients and the server [15]. Client Selector. The client selection process optimizes re- source usage and system scalability by sampling only clients that are best suited for contributing to global model im- provements [7], [15]. In our experiments, we test a resource- based selection strategy, which confirms that this pattern significantly reduces total round time in FL. By including one Low-Spec client, we observe that the total round time increases up to 9 \u00d7, as Low-Spec clients generate significant system bottlenecks. Indeed, when \u201cslow\u201d clients are included in the FL round, other nodes of the system (i.e., clients and server) must wait for slow devices to complete local training and model parameters communication before starting a new round. While this is true for the specific parameters set in our experiments (see Section IV), we are confident that similar behavior can be observed whenever there are further disparities in computational client resources. For instance, data-based selection criteria select only clients with high-quality data (i.e., rich and varying training samples). A limitation of the Client Selector pattern is that excluding clients may lead to a loss of valuable and unique data, potentially reducing the final global model accuracy and limiting its generalization. This is due to some clients holding exclusive portions of data from which the model could learn unique patterns. Additionally, the need to frequently assess clients (i.e., by verifying if they are eligible for the FL round) introduces communication and computational costs, that can significantly increase in systems with a high number of participating devices. Both data-based selection strategy and the overhead of continuously evaluating clients require further investigation, which we plan to address in future work. Client Cluster.Our experiments on the Client Cluster pattern focus on evaluating its impact on the system performance using a data-partition clustering strategy. By grouping clients with similar data distributions (e.g., IID vs. non-IID clusters), this pattern improves the efficiency of the training process in two main directions. First, clustering clients based on data similarity mitigates the impact of non-IID data, which reduces gradient variance and leads to a faster training process. Second, the training process benefits from enhances in local model con- vergence, resulting in improved global model accuracy [10]. Our results show that clustered configurations significantly outperform non-clustered configurations, achieving higher ac- curacy while also reducing the average round training time. However, there are some drawbacks that software architects need to consider when implementing a Client Cluster pattern. The central server needs additional computational costs and processing time for clustering clients and quantifying their relationships, which can impact system efficiency in large scenarios [10]. Furthermore, clustering requires the server to access extra client information, increasing the risk of exposing sensitive data. As future work, we can use aggregated or anonymized metrics for clustering, thus mitigating the risk of revealing sensitive data [15]. Message Compressor. Experiments conducted in this paper show a varying impact of the message compression mecha- nism, depending on the size of the global model. For smaller models, as in the n/2 configuration, the compression intro- duces a notable overhead, resulting in increased communica- tion time. Here, the computational cost associated with com- pression outweighs the benefits, as evidenced by consistently higher times across most rounds. In the n configuration, the reduction in communication time with compression, although small, shows an improvement. At this scale, the compression benefits start being visible and lead to a slight improvement in communication time. When the model size doubles (e.g., in the n*2 configuration) the advantage of compression becomes more evident. In this case, compressing data significantly shortens the communication time, fully compensating for the overhead introduced by compression and decompression steps. Given that the compression (and decompression) process may introduce additional computational costs, as future work we plan to introduce a trade-off analysis between the size of the global model and the overhead introduced by (de)compression mechanisms, thus enabling compression only when beneficial. B. Threats to Validity Besides inheriting all limitations of architectural patterns and performance analysis [28], [29], our approach exhibits the following threats to validity [30]. External validity, i.e., generalization of results, is not guar- anteed, since our experimental setup is subject to certain limitations due to the available physical resources. Our com- modity hardware comes with a limited number of physical processors, thus restricting the actual number of client devices in our experiments. Consequently, our quantitative analysis is representative for a small client population, which may not fully reflect the dynamics of large-scale FL networks. Nevertheless, experimental results provide valuable insights into the potential applicability of our methodology. Internal validity , i.e., settings and parameters used for performance analysis, is also exposed to potential threats, since we use numerical values that provide evidence of per- formance variations for each pattern. For instance, we vary CPU allocations among clients to highlight the client selector\u2019s response to differing resource availability. Additionally, by maintaining consistent input settings across experiments for each pattern, we minimize misleading effects, ensuring that observed outcomes could be reliably attributed to specific ar- chitectural choices. However, determining accurate numerical values for input parameters is an ever existing challenge in software performance [31] and other settings could be further investigated. As an example, clustering clients considering different configurations (i.e., clients holding different data distribution types) may reveal varying performance character- istics. Accordingly, we remark that experiment setup instruc- tions for testing different input parameter values are publicly available [13], and software architects can modify parameters to conduct experiments as needed. Construct validity, i.e., the statistical validity of the exper- imental results, is established by repeating each experimental configuration 10 times, averaging output values, and calculat- ing the 99% confidence interval to assess the accuracy of the reported numerical results. VI. R ELATED WORK Architectural Patterns. The motivation of our work is supported by a large literature underscoring the importance of adopting architectural patterns in designing software sys- tems [32]\u2013[34]. Besides, the software architecture community recently enforce the adoption of patterns to address design and operational challenges in machine learning systems [35]\u2013[38]. Washizaki et al. [35] conduct a study to classify architectural patterns specifically designed for machine learning systems, providing developers with a framework for selecting suitable architectural solutions. This work highlights the need for sys- tematic performance evaluation of these patterns, i.e., the main contribution of our research. Leest et al. [39] and Takeuchi et al. [40] present structured approaches to address real-world design challenges in machine learning systems. Federated Learning. Compared to centralized machine learning, FL offers additional advantages regarding efficiency and privacy aspects [10], [11]. However, FL needs to face additional architectural challenges, i.e., managing server-client interactions. Di Martino et al. [11] and Lo et al. [2] pro- pose reference architectures to design FL systems. These architectures integrate the patterns discussed in this work, underscoring the value of structured approaches for improving system robustness. However, they lack quantitative perfor- mance evaluation, leaving a gap in the empirical assessment of proposed systems, as we do in this paper. Ma et al. [41] present a framework for FL that uses the Client Selector pattern to identify and exclude unreliable clients, thus preserving system performance by avoiding faulty updates. Pavlidis et al. [42] expand on client selection by introducing an algorithm that prioritizes clients based on computational power and network conditions, aiming to reduce delays from slower clients while achieving good model accuracy. Both studies highlight the advantages of client selection strategies, suggesting that further research is needed to evaluate their impact on performance, which aligns with the contribution of our work. The closest related methodologies are reported hereafter. Lai et al. [9] propose a FL benchmark engine. Differently from our investigation, the authors focus on building a standardized benchmarking suite for FL systems rather than providing an empirical assessment of how architectural patterns af- fect system performance. Casalicchio et al. [43] propose a workbench platform for the performance evaluation of FL systems implementing patterns proposed by [10]. We initially considered this work for comparison, but it lacks instructions on how to reproduce the experiment results and access to the proposed tool, making the correlation impossible. To summarize, to the best of our knowledge, most related studies emphasize the importance of implementing architec- tural patterns in designing FL systems. Our work addresses the lack of publicly available methodologies that evaluate their impact and implications on system performance. VII. C ONCLUSION This paper supports software architects with an investigation of how architectural patterns affect the performance of FL systems, thus providing a quantitative evaluation of a subset of design decisions. To this end, we implement and evaluate four architectural patterns deemed relevant for system performance in the literature [10]. Our findings indicate that architectural patterns are valid candidates to address FL design challenges, although pros and cons need to be considered, i.e., the performance improvement comes at the cost of introducing overhead to actually apply these patterns. Specifically, the Client Registry pattern centrally stores client data, enhancing client management and serving as a foundation for other patterns. The Client Selector reduces total round time by exploiting the information collected on clients. The Client Cluster reduces training time and increases model accuracy by grouping clients on the basis of data similarities. The Message Compressor reduces communication time for large models, although a trade-off between compression overhead and model size is necessary to achieve optimal efficiency. In future work, besides addressing all limitations and threats to validity discussed above, we also plan to extend our ex- periments by investigating potential combinations of different patterns, e.g., applying the Client Selector to clustered clients.

However, the design of Federated Learning systems requires non-trivial architectural choices to address several challenges, such as system efficiency and learning accuracy. Architectural patterns for Federated Learning systems have been defined in the literature to handle these challenges, but their experimentation is limited. The objective of this paper is to empower software architects in their task of evaluating the design of FL systems while deciding which architectural alternatives are more beneficial in their context of adoption. Our methodology consists of a tool-based approach that embeds the implementation of six architectural patterns defined in the literature. The advantage is that software architects can select design alternatives either in isolation or in a combined fashion, and the subsequent analysis provides the evaluation of some metrics of interest. The experimental results indicate that architectural patterns can enhance system efficiency, although we found a combination of patterns that added overhead and turned to limit its benefit. By quantifying these trade-offs, we aim to support software architects in designing Federated Learning systems by evaluating the benefits and drawbacks of applying architectural patterns. 1. Introduction Modern digital devices generate massive volumes of data that grow exponentially and contribute to feed advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques (Hastie et al., 2009). Data represents a crucial aspect in this context, since several factors play a key role during learning, e.g., data representativeness directly influences predictive performance (Augen- stein et al., 2020). With the increasing reliance of ML on sensitive information, data privacy has become a critical concern (Jobin et al., 2019). Consequently, software solutions must ensure both trustworthi- ness and compliance with legal requirements, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (European Commission, 2018). To face these challenges, in 2016 Google introduced Federated Learning (FL), i.e., a paradigm that enables devices to collaboratively train a shared global model while keeping sensitive data locally (McMa- han et al., 2017). This approach has rapidly emerged as a practical and effective solution to handle data privacy and enhance user trust (Zhang et al., 2024; S\u00e1nchez et al., 2024), fostering its adoption across sev- eral domains, from healthcare to mobile applications (Kairouz et al., 2021). However, recent studies argue that designing FL systems is still challenging (Baresi et al., 2023). For instance, the optimization of I This article is part of a Special issue entitled: \u2018SoftArch\u2019 published in The Journal of Systems & Software.

Trubiani). system performance emerges as a relevant concern, as FL systems must balance data protection, communication efficiency, optimal resource management, and model accuracy (Zhang et al., 2021). State-of-the-art research on FL primarily focuses on optimizing learning algorithms (McMahan et al., 2016; Li et al., 2020c), model compression (Zhu et al., 2023; Shah and Lau, 2023), and parameters\u2019 aggregation strategies (Qi et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2022). The system performance is instead handled by a few approaches (Lai et al., 2022; Casalicchio et al., 2023), even if it is well assessed that system per- formance problems may hurt the functioning (Kairouz et al., 2021), especially in real-world deployments aiming at guaranteeing system efficiency along with reliability and user trust (Zhang et al., 2024). In this context, the design of FL systems represents the primary abstraction that contributes to the subsequent development choices, the architec- tural decisions become of key importance since they constitute the foundations of the FL process (Lo et al., 2022; Lai et al., 2022). Besides, architectural inefficiencies may lead to training failures and resource depletion, potentially undermining the trustworthiness properties that FL aims to ensure (Kairouz et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024). To address these challenges, in the literature there is a recent effort of https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2025.112655 Received 27 February 2025; Received in revised form 31 July 2025; Accepted 9 October 2025 The Journal of Systems and Software 232 (2026) 112655 Available online 1 November 2025 0164-1212/\u00a9 2025 The Authors.

Compagnucci et al. adopting architectural patterns specifically perceived for FL systems (Lo et al., 2022). In software engineering, architectural patterns represent reusable solutions to a problem that occurs commonly within a given context in software design (Beck, 1987). The benefit of relying on the specification of patterns is that they provide a pool of design alternatives that may represent valid options for software architects (Lo et al., 2022). The overarching research question we address in this paper is: What is the quantitative impact of applying different design alternatives on FL systems? We propose an approach that evaluates the behavior of FL systems, thereby supporting software architects in taking informed design decisions. In our previous work (Compagnucci et al., 2025b), we presented a quantitative evaluation of architectural patterns for FL systems using Flower (Beutel et al., 2020), i.e., a Python library for FL. By extending its codebase, we implemented and evaluated four architectural patterns from Lo et al. (2022): the Client Registry, which provides a central- ized storage of client data enabling efficient management, the Client Selector, which reduces training round time by intelligently filtering clients, the Client Cluster, which improves both training time and model accuracy by grouping clients based on data similarities, and the Message Compressor, which optimizes communication overhead while balancing compression costs. The objective of our research is to support software architects in understanding the impact of design alternatives on FL systems. To this end, we propose AP4Fed, a benchmark framework that enables the selection and the combination of six architectural patterns. The outcome of the analysis consists of reports that estimate some metrics of interest, specifically we target the following two main indicators: (i) system performance, that represents the computational overhead gener- ated by the FL process, and (ii) predictive performance, that refers to the learned model accuracy. In this paper, two novel architectural patterns are implemented and evaluated: (\ud835\udc56) Heterogeneous Data Handler, which aims to improve the quality of datasets owned by clients participating in the FL process; (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) Multi-Task Model Trainer, which is designed to train separated but related ML tasks simultaneously. In addition, we experiment with the combination of previously defined patterns (Com- pagnucci et al., 2025b) with the newly introduced ones, specifically: (\ud835\udc56) Heterogeneous Data Handler is combined with Message Compressor, thus studying the joint optimization of data quality and communication efficiency; (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) Multi-Task Model Trainer is combined with Client Selector, thus investigating the joint effort of optimizing model accuracy and sys- tem efficiency. Summarizing, the main contributions of this manuscript are: 1. The development of AP4Fed (Compagnucci et al., 2025a), i.e., a tool that supports software architects in experimenting different design decisions through the selection and combination of six architectural patterns; 2. The implementation of two architectural patterns and their ex- perimentation either in isolation or in combination with other patterns, while measuring system performance and predictive performance; 3. Empirical results showcase benefits and drawbacks of architec- tural patterns, thus providing quantitative evidence that sup- ports software architects in understanding pattern(s) trade-offs. The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background knowledge on FL systems and architectural pat- terns. Section 3 describes the methodology and the framework used for the experiments. Section 4 reports the analysis of architectural patterns, both in isolation and in a combined fashion. Section 5 argues on the obtained experimental results and their implications. Sec- tion 6 discusses related work and highlights the main differences with our research. Section 7 concludes the paper by outlining the main contributions and directions for future research. Fig. 1. Federated Learning Overview, inspired by Lo et al. (2022). 2. Background 2.1. Federated Learning Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a solution to the growing chal- lenge of utilizing a large amount of sensitive and personal data (McMa- han et al., 2017; Lo et al., 2022). While this data is invaluable for training ML models capable of improving decision-making in software systems (Zhang et al., 2021), its sensitive nature raises significant pri- vacy concerns when shared with centralized servers (Banabilah et al., 2022). To address this, FL enables multiple client devices to collab- oratively train a global ML model using their local data under the coordination of a central server (Lo et al., 2022; Banabilah et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2021). This distributed system allows to preserve data privacy and distributing computation across a network, FL not only addresses privacy concerns but also enhances scalability and reduces reliance on centralized processing resources (Kairouz et al., 2021). Fig. 1 depicts the main phases of the FL paradigm. It begins with a central server broadcasting the initial global model parameters (e.g., model weights and structure) to all participating clients 1\u20dd. Once all clients receive these parameters, each device performs local model training using its private data 2\u20dd. Upon completing the training, clients send their updated model parameters (i.e., the trained model weights) back to the central server 3\u20dd. The server then aggregates these updates to produce a refined version of the global model 4\u20dd. The updated global model is subsequently redistributed to the clients, initiating the next round of training. The process repeats iteratively, with the global model continuously improving until convergence is achieved. This mechanism ensures collaborative learning while preserving data privacy, as data remains decentralized throughout the process. 2.2. Architectural patterns in federated learning systems Architectural patterns provide reusable solutions to recurring design challenges in complex systems (Richards, 2015). They represent best practices in design, enabling developers and software architects to address concerns such as scalability and modularity while preserving system efficiency (Lo et al., 2022). In our previous work (Compagnucci et al., 2025b), we implemented and evaluated a subset of architectural alternatives defined by Lo et al. (2022), specifically: the (\ud835\udc56) Client Registry that stores information on clients contributing to the training; (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) the Client Selector that improves the system efficiency by selecting clients based on some preferred criteria, e.g., more computational power; (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) the Client Cluster that enhances the training efficiency by grouping clients based on their similarities; (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63) the Message Compressor that increases communication efficiency by reducing the message data size. In this work, we keep focusing on quantitatively evaluating FL systems, and investigate two additional architectural patterns that are The Journal of Systems & Software 232 (2026) 112655 2 I. Compagnucci et al. Fig. 2. Heterogeneous Data Handler Pattern overview. considered essential for enhancing system efficiency (Lo et al., 2022). The first pattern, namely Heterogeneous Data Handler, performs pre- processing operations on local datasets to enhance data quality across all clients participating in the FL process. The second pattern, i.e., the so-called Multi-Task Model Trainer, enables the simultaneous training of multiple ML tasks. These two patterns are detailed in the following. 2.2.1. Heterogeneous Data Handler architectural pattern Context. The Heterogeneous Data Handler pattern aims to improve the quality of datasets owned by clients participating in the FL process. This architectural alternative consists of employing techniques such as: (\ud835\udc56) data augmentation, which creates synthetic data to increase the diversity and volume of local datasets, and (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) federated distillation, that periodically provides knowledge from other devices to clients (without directly accessing other devices\u2019 data) (Lo et al., 2022). As shown in Fig. 2, these techniques help balance data distributions across clients while preserving local data privacy and avoiding the need for centralized data collection (Zhang et al., 2021). The primary benefit of the Heterogeneous Data Handler pattern lies in its ability to enhance the generalization and accuracy of the global model by improving the quality of client datasets (Lo et al., 2022). Through techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the architectural alternative consists of addressing challenges related to the imbalanced nature of the non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) dataset (Li et al., 2020b) by generating synthetic examples that increase diversity and fill gaps in underrepresented classes. This leads to a more effective training process and reduces reliance on uniform data distributions. However, this design alternative may introduce computational over- head from performing local operations, and privacy concerns since dataset analysis is required for augmentation and knowledge transfer. Our Implementation. To implement the Heterogeneous Data Handler pattern, we leverage the PyTorchGAN (Pal and Das, 2021) Python library, exploiting its capabilities to augment data through synthetic sample generation and thereby mitigating the imbalance of clients local non-IID datasets. Specifically, we employ a conditional GAN model trained to produce class-specific data samples, effectively augmenting underrepresented classes in each client dataset. The Heterogeneous Data Handler pattern is integrated by first analyzing the class distri- bution of each client dataset, and then generating synthetic data to balance class proportions. After applying GAN-based augmentation, up- dated datasets exhibit reduced class imbalance, enabling more effective training of the global model. Results show that this approach mitigates challenges posed by non-IID data while preserving local data privacy. 2.2.2. Multi-Task Model Trainer architectural pattern Context. The Multi-Task Model Trainer pattern is designed to train separated but related ML tasks (Lo et al., 2022). A ML task is a defined problem that a system addresses by identifying similarities and relationships from data (Zhang and Yang, 2022). It encompasses the model objective, the type of predictions or decisions it needs to make, Fig. 3. Multi-Task Model Trainer Pattern Overview. Fig. 4. The Multi-Task Model Trainer Pattern in the Robot Use Case. and the structure of the data it processes. Examples may include image classification, speech recognition or time series forecasting (Antoniou et al., 2018; Zhang and Yang, 2022). As shown in Fig. 3, this architec- tural alternative consists of enabling scenarios where clients share data to train two ML tasks, T1 and T2. These tasks can subsequently result in two possible outcomes: (\ud835\udc56) the generation of two distinct global models, which we will refer to as M1 and M2, or (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) the combination of tasks into a single unified global model, referred to as M3 (Lo et al., 2022). M3 is designed to tackle both tasks simultaneously by leveraging shared data, ensuring the model effectively achieves the objective of both tasks. Challenges of statistical heterogeneity in FL systems, particularly when dealing with non-IID data across clients, often lead to poor model generalization and thereby lower accuracy (Kairouz et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2017). By considering additional clients with relevant data for a specific task, this design alternative can partially mitigate the non- IID data problem by providing additional samples, thereby enhancing the global model accuracy. To better illustrate this approach, consider the example depicted in Fig. 4, which shows a robot performing two interconnected computer vision tasks, i.e., the semantic segmentation and the depth estimation. Semantic segmentation allows the robot to identify and classify objects within its environment (Ronneberger et al., 2015), while depth estimation determines the distance and spatial structure of the surrounding area (Khan et al., 2020). By combining semantic segmentation and depth estimation, the robot enhances its ability to navigate and interact with the environment more precisely. The multi-task learning approach builds upon shared knowledge, thus the global model can adapt to heterogeneous data across clients (Lo et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2017). Our Implementation. To implement the Multi-Task Model Trainer pattern, we design a FL simulation capable of simultaneously training multiple tasks by leveraging both shared and task-specific data. The training process is organized as follows: each client performs local updates for both T1 and T2 by computing gradients and weights independently for each task. These updates are then aggregated at the The Journal of Systems & Software 232 (2026) 112655 3 I. Compagnucci et al. Fig. 5. AP4Fed Infrastructure Overview. server level where a single unified model (M3) is generated. To achieve this, AP4Fed extends the Flower standard configure_fit1 method, which is responsible for configuring the upcoming training round (Beu- tel et al., 2020). AP4Fed incorporates a strategy that dynamically directs the updated weights provided by clients to the corresponding task during the training process. This ensures that each client\u2019s local train- ing data effectively contributes to the global model for its respective task(s). After completing their local training, clients send to the server their updated weights, which are then aggregated using a weighted averaging mechanism based on the number of samples processed by each client. 3. Methodology Introduction. Our methodology consists of developing AP4Fed, a flexible FL benchmark framework that enables software architects to design, configure, and evaluate FL systems through the composition of mixed architectural patterns, enabling quantitative evaluation of their impact. The open source code and the documentation on how to use the developed tool is publicly available (Compagnucci et al., 2025a). The AP4Fed infrastructure, depicted in Fig. 5, builds on the Flower Python library (\ud835\udc631.12.0) (Beutel et al., 2020), a framework designed to support the configuration and simulation of FL systems. Flower pro- vides core functionalities such as client\u2013server communication, global model updates, and round-based coordination, which serve as the foun- dation for AP4Fed. Beyond these core features, AP4Fed introduces a set of architectural patterns and metrics to benchmarking FL simulations. These additions enable the extraction of advanced metrics and provide greater flexibility for configuring and evaluating diverse FL scenarios. The framework leverage the PyTorch library (\ud835\udc632.5.0) (Paszke et al., 2019) for ML tasks, allowing each client to perform local training on its data. AP4Fed uses PyQt5 (\ud835\udc635.15.11) to provide a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) that simplifies the process of configuring simulation parameters and modeling FL systems for experimentation. This interface guides users through the setup process, thus enabling the emulation of typical real-world FL architectures. Methods. Fig. 6 presents a BPMN diagram (Compagnucci et al., 2024) that illustrates how AP4Fed works. Its core workflow is split into three phases. The 1\u20dd Project Setup phase enables users to either start a new FL simulation or load an existing configuration from a JSON file. In the former case, the simulation can be configured to run in a local environment (to experiment with different ML strategies and algo- rithms) or in a container-based setup (to emulate real-world systems, ensure efficient resource allocation, and prevent resource overcom- mitment (Cohen et al., 2019)). In the latter one, users can customize predefined settings defined in the JSON file. 1 Further details are available at https://flower.ai/docs/framework/ explanation-flower-strategy-abstraction.html. The second phase of the AP4Fed workflow is 2\u20dd System Configuration. Fig. 6 shows that the configuration involves three main tasks: (i) system parameters, (ii) client details, and (iii) architectural patterns. Fig. 7 reports the configuration GUI of AP4Fed, specifically: system parameters (e.g., the number of rounds), see Fig. 7(a); client details (e.g., number of allocated CPUs), see Fig. 7(b); architectural patterns (e.g., the client selector requires a selection strategy), see Fig. 7(c). A graphical overview of all parameters is presented in Fig. 7(d). Table 1 summarizes the parameters in a tabular format. The system parameters are: the simulation_Type that can be Local or Docker, the number of FL rounds (num_Rounds) that can vary between 1 and \ud835\udc5f, and the number of clients (nC) whose minimum value is 2 and the maximum can be set to \ud835\udc50. Each client is detailed with an identifier (client_ID), the resource allocation (i.e., n_CPU, RAM), the testing dataset, e.g., CIFAR-10, and the data_Distribu- tion type that can be IID, non-IID, or random. The architectural patterns present the following settings. The CLIENT REGISTRY pat- tern is always enabled since it provides key client data on which other patterns rely on. The CLIENT SELECTOR pattern, when activated, re- quires the following settings: selection_strategy (e.g., Resource- based), selection_criteria (e.g., CPU), and criteria_value (e.g., >1). For instance, only clients with more than one CPU re- source are selected, whereas all others are excluded. The CLIENT CLUSTER pattern, when enabled, necessitates these settings: clus- tering_strategy (e.g., Data-based), and clustering_crite- ria (e.g., Data Distribution Type). For example, clients are clustered via their data type. The MESSAGE COMPRESSOR pattern, when acti- vated, reduces communication costs by compressing data exchanged between clients and server. The MULTI-TASK MODEL TRAINER pat- tern, when enabled, needs the specification of both the model ar- chitectures M1 and M2 (e.g., U-Net) and the corresponding datasets M1_dataset and M2_dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10). For instance, two datasets are used for training, both in isolation than in combination. The HETEROGENEOUS DATA HANDLER pattern, when activated, gen- erates synthetic data that balance the representativeness of classes in the datasets. We recall that these parameters are set by users and they feed the JSON configuration file, see a concrete example in Listing 1. This way, users can download the entire configuration as a JSON file, that can later be uploaded when creating a new FL project, thereby enabling easy reuse of previously defined setups. The 3\u20dd Simulation phase allows to run the simulation and collect results. AP4Fed embeds a prompt that provides an overview of the simulation, detailing aspects such as the training time or other infor- mation on implemented patterns, as shown in Fig. 8a. This offers a detailed explanation of the current state of the simulation, aiding the reasoning of the ongoing process. Upon completion, the tool generates a set of summary plots, as shown in Fig. 8(b), and it offers the option to download a complete report of the simulation in a CSV format. 1 { 2 SYSTEM_PARAMETERS : [ 3 { 4 simulation_Type : \" Docker \" , 5 num_Rounds : 100 , 6 nC : 10 , 7 }, 8 ] 9 CLIENT_DETAILS : [ 10 { 11 client_id : 1, 12 n_CPU : 2, 13 RAM : 2, 14 dataset : \" FMNIST \" , 15 data_Distribution : \" IID \" 16 }, 17 { 18 client_id : 2, 19 n_CPU : 1, 20 RAM : 2, 21 dataset : \" CIFAR -10 \" , 22 data_Distribution : \" non -IID \" The Journal of Systems & Software 232 (2026) 112655 4 I.

Results. Table 2 provides the description of the implemented evalu- ation metrics, building on approaches proposed in the literature (Jiang et al., 2022; Ronneberger et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2020). Those metrics are selected to capture system performance and predictive performance variations, thus providing insights for different architectural choices. System performance metrics are collected at different granularity lev- els. The training time and the communication time are calculated for each client. The total round time instead represents the time required to complete one round considering all the participating clients. Re- garding resource utilization, the tool monitors two key metrics for federated learning (Soudan et al., 2025; Alawadi et al., 2024): the Cen- tral Processing Unit (CPU) usage and Random Access Memory (RAM) The Journal of Systems & Software 232 (2026) 112655 5 I.

We also evaluate the predictive performance metrics, following standard advices from the literature (Jiang et al., 2022; Khan et al., 2020; Ronneberger et al., 2015). For classification problems, we derive the F1 score to balance precision and recall, while for regression tasks, we employ the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to quantify the prediction accuracy. Discussion. The outcome of our methodology consists of a report that captures a set of evaluation metrics from simulations. The produced report is aimed to collect knowledge on the FL system under analysis, along with information on the different architectural alternatives and their quantitative impact. We think this knowledge may represent a precious support for software architects that are in charge of comparing The Journal of Systems & Software 232 (2026) 112655 6 I. Compagnucci et al. Fig. 9. Random samples of the NYUv2 datasets. different design alternatives, and deriving insights for improving the system performance and the predictive performance. This way, our quantitative evaluation can be used by software architects to take informed architectural decisions. 4. Experiments 4.1. Experiments configuration In this subsection, we describe the experimental setup used to eval- uate the proposed architectural patterns, including the Heterogeneous Data Handler Pattern, the Multi-task Model Trainer one, and the use of combined patterns. We outline the system configuration, datasets, and the structure of the global models employed in our analysis. The goal is to assess the impact of these design alternatives on system performance and predictive performance. Subject Systems. To fairly evaluate experiment output metrics, we report mean results obtained over 10 iterations, along with a 99% confidence interval, represented using lines and shaded areas in the plots. Each experiment is conducted using different ML models tailored to the specific ML task under evaluation. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed as the global model for image classification tasks. For semantic segmentation, a U-Net architecture was utilized, leveraging its well-established effectiveness in capturing fine-grained spatial details. In the case of depth estimation, the DenseU-Net (Khan et al., 2020) is adopted to exploit feature reuse and enhance depth prediction accuracy. For training global models, we use the CIFAR- 10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) and NYUv2 (Nathan Silberman and Fergus, 2012) datasets. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32 \u00d7 32 color images, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing, divided into 10 distinct classes. Each class includes images of objects or animals (e.g., trucks, dogs), providing a challenging task for the CNN to accurately classify test images into one of the 10 categories. The NYUv2 dataset consists of 1,449 480 \u00d7 640 different images captured from a variety of indoor environments. As depicted in Fig. 9, the dataset comprises three types of data: 1,449 RGB images, 1,449 depth maps, and 1,449 .npy files. The RGB image in Fig. 9(a) capture the visual details of a scene, while the corresponding depth map in Fig. 9(b) reveal spatial information by encoding the distance of surfaces from the camera perspective. The .npy file stores 2D arrays, with each value representing a specific object class (e.g., 0 for background, 1 for table, etc.) that corresponds to a pixel in the RGB image. This information is visually represented in Fig. 9(c). Hardware Setup. Experiments are conducted using a workstation machine with an Intel Xeon W5-2445 featuring a 20 Core CPU @3.1GHz and 64 GB of RAM alongside an NVIDIA RTX A4500 GPU. Note that, AP4Fed first checks if a Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) GPU (Li et al., 2024) is available, and if not, it automatically uses the CPU. Using Docker Compose, resources such as processing units (i.e., CPU cores) and RAM can be manually allocated to each con- tainer, enabling flexible experiment setups tailored to specific needs. This setup enables the emulation of heterogeneous clients, incorporat- ing variations in the dataset distribution and clients specifications, to Table 3 Input Parameters for Heterogeneous Data Handler experiments.

Notably, the maximum number of concurrently running containers is constrained by the host machine\u2019s capacity (i.e., 10 cores) to avoid CPU overcommitment. This limitation is essential, as surpassing the processing limits of the host can result in resource contention, potentially invalidating the replicability and validity of experimental results (Cohen et al., 2019). 4.2. Quantitative evaluation of architectural patterns In this subsection, we present the configurations and results of the experimental analysis conducted to evaluate the two newly im- plemented architectural patterns. Then, we report the experimental results from combining these architectural alternatives together in two distinct configurations to assess their impact on system and predictive performance. 4.2.1. Analysis of the heterogeneous data handler pattern Table 3 presents input parameters used for the Heterogeneous Data Handler Pattern experiment. The experiment is repeated for 10 it- erations, and result metrics are then averaged. The setup involves 10 rounds of FL with 1 server and 8 clients with 1 CPU and 2GB of RAM. To quantitatively evaluate this pattern, we use the Dirich- let distribution (Yurochkin et al., 2019) to partition non-IID datasets for some clients.2 This method, widely used in FL experiments (Li et al., 2020b; Yu et al., 2019), allows for emulating varied data dis- tributions, replicating the data heterogeneity commonly observed in real-world scenarios (Kairouz et al., 2021). For completeness, we report the Dirichlet distribution formula: \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652, \u2026 , \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58) = 1 \ud835\udc35(\ud835\udefc) \ud835\udc58\u220f \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\u22121 \ud835\udc56 (1) The Dirichlet distribution\u2019s probability density function, \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652, \u2026 , \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58) is normalized by the beta function \ud835\udc35(\ud835\udefc), ensuring the total prob- ability equals one. The parameters \ud835\udefc = (\ud835\udefc1, \ud835\udefc2, \u2026 , \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc58) control the level 2 https://flower.ai/docs/datasets/ref-api/flwr_datasets.partitioner.

Here \ud835\udefc defines the degree of unbalance, allowing adjustments to test different levels of data non-uniformity in the partitioning. To accommodate the CIFAR-10 dataset\u2019s limit of 5,000 samples per class (across 10 classes), the number of training examples is reduced from 50,000 to 25,000 enabling a different allocation of non-IID data. This way, we assign a different number of samples across classes to each client while ensuring that the total number of samples remains equal across all clients, allowing for comparable experiment configurations. For instance, in IID clients, each class in the CIFAR- 10 dataset has 2,500 training examples, while non-IID clients exhibit imbalanced distributions, such as 500 examples for cat and 4,500 for truck, ensuring the total number of training examples remains consis- tent across clusters. The characteristics of the global model used in the experiment are reported in Fig. 10. The CNN architecture, described in Fig. 10(a), consists of two convolutional layers (Conv1 and Conv2) with ReLU activations, followed by max-pooling (Pool1 and Pool2) layers. Conv1 has 6 filters (5 \u00d7 5 kernel), and Conv2 has 16 filters (5 \u00d7 5 kernel). The model then transitions to three fully connected (FC) layers: FC1 (120 units), FC2 (84 units), and a FC3 (10 units). Training uses a batch size of 32, a learning rate of 0.001, and SGD with 0.9 momentum. The graphical representation of the model is displayed in Fig. 10(b). The Heterogeneous Data Handler architectural pattern is imple- mented following the data augmentation strategy (Lo et al., 2022) based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs, introduced by Goodfellow et al. (2014), operate through a competitive process between two neural networks: a generator, which creates synthetic data samples mimicking real data, and a discriminator, which aims to distinguish between generated and real samples. Fig. 11 depicts the general use of a GAN. Through adversarial training, the generator creates synthetic data from the real dataset while the discriminator evaluates authenticity. The GAN is considered well-trained when the discriminator can no longer differentiate between real and synthetic data, enabling high- quality synthetic data generation (Goodfellow et al., 2014). For in- stance, considering a facial images dataset, a GAN can produce vari- ations by altering features like hair color or expression while maintain- ing core identity traits. This capability makes GANs especially useful for addressing dataset imbalances, as they can generate high-quality exam- ples for underrepresented classes. In FL contexts, GANs are recognized as an effective solution for non-IID data challenges, generating addi- tional samples to reduce disparities among clients\u2019 local datasets (Jeong et al., 2018; Antoniou et al., 2018). The effectiveness of GANs for data augmentation is well-documented (Antoniou et al., 2018), with successful implementations across various domains including image generation (Brock et al., 2019), image-to-image translation (Zhu et al., 2017), and Natural Language Processing (Zhang et al., 2017). As reported in Table 4, we evaluate the Heterogeneous Data Handler pattern through four different experiment configurations labeled \ud835\udc34, \ud835\udc35, \ud835\udc36, and \ud835\udc37. In each configuration, we consider 8 Clients and 1 Server. In Config. \ud835\udc34 all clients use datasets with an IID data distribution, while in Config. \ud835\udc35, clients are configured with datasets following a non-IID data distribution. In Config. \ud835\udc36 4 clients use IID datasets and the other 4 use non-IID datasets. Similarly, Config. \ud835\udc37 also consists of 4 clients with IID datasets and 4 with non-IID datasets. However, in Config. \ud835\udc37, the Heterogeneous Data Handler pattern is applied to the set of non- IID clients, adjusting their data distribution to closely resemble that of IID clients. Fig. 12 highlights the impact of the Heterogeneous Data Handler pattern in effectively augmenting the non-IID clients datasets, showing the transition of the class distribution from a non-IID to an IID configuration. Fig. 13 shows the results of this experiment. Fig. 13(a) depicts the F1 Score of each global model across the FL rounds. Config. \ud835\udc34 and Config. \ud835\udc37, which both perform the FL process without clients using non-IID datasets, exhibit similar trends. However, Config. \ud835\udc34 shows faster convergence, reaching a higher F1 Score earlier in the process. Config. \ud835\udc35 and Config. \ud835\udc36, which include clients with non-IID datasets, show notably lower F1 Scores, indicating reduced model accuracy and slower convergence. Among these, Config. \ud835\udc35, composed exclusively of clients with non-IID datasets, performs significantly worse. Notably, its F1 Score even declines during some rounds, dropping from 0.13 to 0.11 between rounds 8 and 9, highlighting the negative impact of non-IID data on the global model accuracy. Fig. 13(b) presents the average total round time during FL rounds. The configurations involving clients with non-IID datasets (i.e., Config. \ud835\udc35 and Config. \ud835\udc36) show longer and less stable average round times, as reflected by the wider confidence intervals derived from 10 experiment iterations. Notably, Config. \ud835\udc35, which consists exclusively of clients with non-IID datasets, records the longest average round times, ranging between 700 and 800 s per FL round, making it the most time-consuming configuration analyzed. This highlights the significant impact of data non-IIDness on the duration of FL rounds. This aligns with practitioners\u2019 expectations, confirming that training times can increase when rounds include clients with non- IID data (Li et al., 2020b; Yu et al., 2019). Fig. 13(c) depicts the ratio of F1 Score to the average total round time that we define as efficiency, thereby capturing the trade-off between predictive perfor- mance and system performance. Results indicate that configurations involving clients with non-IID datasets exhibit substantially lower ef- ficiency, underscoring challenges associated with heterogeneous data distributions (Lo et al., 2022). In contrast, configurations composed only by IID clients (Config. \ud835\udc34) or employing the Heterogeneous Data Handler (Config. \ud835\udc37) achieve higher efficiency, pointing out the positive impact of balanced data distributions and tailored handling strategies. Architectural Implications. Software architects can consider this ar- chitectural pattern when dealing with a relevant number of clients that The Journal of Systems & Software 232 (2026) 112655 8 I.

Experimental results demon- strate that applying GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) technique to clients participating in the FL rounds improve model accuracy by balancing heterogeneous data distributions. 4.2.2. Analysis of the Multi-Task Model Trainer pattern Table 5 reports input parameters used for the Multi-Task Model Trainer Pattern experiment. Output metrics are evaluated by consid- ering the average values over the 10 simulation iterations. The setup includes 10 FL rounds, with a single server and 4 clients collaborating for each training task, each equipped with 1 CPU and 2GB of RAM. To quantitatively evaluate this pattern, we use the NYUv2 dataset, focusing on two distinct ML tasks labeled T1 and T2. Fig. 14 illustrates how these tasks are implemented in practice. Semantic segmentation (T1) classifies each pixel into one of 40 predefined object classes (e.g., 0 for background, 1 for table, etc.), with distinct colors denoting differ- ent objects, as shown in Fig. 14(a). Similarly, depth estimation (T2) predicts the distance of objects from the camera, generating a per-pixel depth map that enhances spatial perception, as shown in Fig. 14(b). Fig. 15 presents the architectural characteristics of both global models used in our experiments. For T1, we employ a U-Net architecture with an encoder\u2013decoder structure. The parameters of the model are depicted in Fig. 15(a) and the graphical structure is shown in Fig. 15(b). The encoder features three blocks of double 3 \u00d7 3 convolutions with increasing filters (32, 64, 128), while the decoder mirrors this structure with decreasing filters (128, 64, 32). A 256-filter bottleneck connects these components, concluding with a 40 filters and a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution layer. For T2, we implement a DenseU-Net architecture characterized by dense connectivity. The parameters of the model are depicted in Fig. 15(c) and the graphical structure is shown in Fig. 15(d). Its encoder The Journal of Systems & Software 232 (2026) 112655 9 I. Compagnucci et al. Fig. 13. Analysis of the Heterogeneous Data Handler Pattern. combines three dense blocks (64, 128, 256 filters) with transition layers (128, 256, 512 filters), connected to the decoder through a 512-filter bottleneck. The decoder reduces filters from 512 to 128 via transition layers and dense blocks (256, 128, 64 filters), ending with a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution. Both models are trained with a batch size of 2 and learning rate of 0.001, using AdamW optimizer for U-Net and SGD with 0.9 momentum for DenseU-Net. As reported in Table 6, we evaluate the Multi-Task Model Trainer Pattern considering 3 different configurations. In each configuration, we maintain a set of 4 clients for training the related ML task. Note that, Configurations M1 and M2 each involve four clients collaborating to train their respective global models, M1 and M2. In the configuration M3, every client participates in each task through sharing data, thereby enabling the simultaneous training of a unified global model M3. Fig. 16 depicts the results of the experiments. For each configura- tion, we conduct a comparative analysis of the three models: M1 and Table 5 Input Parameters for Multi-Task Model Trainer Experiments.

When referring to M3, we evaluate both T1 and T2 independently, as these represent distinct evaluation scenarios. Fig. 16(a) shows the average client training time required to complete an FL round for model M1 and M3. The clients of M1 participating in the training complete their FL rounds in 147 s on average, achieving a reduction of approximately 5.7 s per training round compared to M3. In Fig. 16(b) we compare the average training time of M2 and M3, and again we observe that M2 completes training rounds more efficiently, with an average of 162.1 s compared to 163.5 s for M3, achieving a reduction of approximately 1.4 s per training round. Considering the global model accuracy, Fig. 16(c) depicts the F1 Score comparison between M1 and M3, where M3 shows a consistent improvement in predictive performance, reaching higher F1 scores (0.35) compared to M1 (0.32) by the final FL round. Fig. 16(d) depicts the MAE comparison between M2 and M3, where M3 demonstrates lower error rates, stabiliz- ing around 0.16 compared to M2 higher MAE of 0.18. Then, we consider accuracy and average training time to derive an efficiency metric. For M1, we evaluate the ratio between F1 Score and average training time, multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage efficiency score. For M2, since both MAE and training time are metrics where lower values indicate better efficiency, we calculate their product. These metrics are defined as: Efficiency \ud835\ude7c1 = ( F1 Score Avg. Training Time ) \u00d7 100 Efficiency \ud835\ude7c2 = ( 1 MAE \u00d7 Avg. Training Time ) \u00d7 100 The value of such ratios are shown in Fig. 16(e) and 16(f), where we can notice that the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency (i.e., in term of reducing training time) is achieved when the multi- Task Model Trainer pattern is implemented (Config. M3) in both ML tasks. This improvement is particularly evident in M2, where despite a minimal difference in training time, the pattern achieves better accuracy. For M1, while the difference in training time is slightly more evident, applying the pattern still shows higher accuracy throughout the FL rounds. Fig. 17 compares different configurations by reporting their average CPU utilization. The configuration with the Multi-Task Model Trainer pattern (Config. M3) shows a higher average CPU usage compared to M1 and M2, reflecting the increased computational demand due to the simultaneous management of multiple tasks. Specifically, M3 average CPU usage is approximately 44%, whereas the average utilization of M1 and M2 is lower, i.e., approximately 23% and 27%, respectively. Architectural Implications. Software architects may benefit from ado- pting this pattern when clients possess datasets containing features relevant to multiple ML tasks. The pattern key advantage emerges when clients participate in training multiple global models simultaneously, i.e., their local data can contribute to improving the accuracy of all involved models by leveraging shared data across ML tasks. However, the larger accuracy is achieved at the cost of increasing the utilization of hardware resources. The Journal of Systems & Software 232 (2026) 112655 10 I. Compagnucci et al. Fig. 14.

Combining architectural patterns This section explores the combination of multiple patterns to study if this may yield additional benefits or unexpected drawbacks compared to their isolated use. This way, we investigate how these design alter- natives interact when combined, thus supporting software architects to make informed decisions about system design and leverage potential synergies (Lo et al., 2022; Kairouz et al., 2021). In the following, we report the most interesting interactions we found, specifically the Multi-Task Model Trainer and Heterogeneous Data Handler patterns combined with two patterns from our previous work (Compagnucci et al., 2025b), i.e., the Client Selector and the Message Compressor. The Journal of Systems & Software 232 (2026) 112655 11 I. Compagnucci et al. Fig. 16. Analysis of the Multi-Task Model Trainer Pattern. 4.3.1. Heterogeneous data handler and message compressor Table 7 reports our investigation on comparing another combination of architectural patterns, i.e., Heterogeneous Data Handler and Mes- sage Compressor: the baseline configuration (Config. \ud835\udc34) implements Heterogeneous Data Handler with a mixed client pool (4 IID and 4 non-IID clients), while the combined configuration integrates both the Heterogeneous Data Handler and Message Compressor patterns. The latter combination integrates data augmentation through GAN-based generation with data compression techniques for client\u2013server com- munication. The Heterogeneous Data Handler uses GANs to generate synthetic data to balance non-IID datasets, while the Message Compres- sor aims to reduce the communication overhead by compressing model parameters exchanged between clients and server. Rationale. The combination is meant to reduce communication over- head while handling non-IID data distributions. However, this approach can introduce significant computational overhead, as the system needs to handle both the resource-intensive GAN operations and the addi- tional compression/decompression processes. This is interesting since the increased total round time may lead to outweigh benefits. Experiment. Fig. 18 depicts the results of the experiment. Fig. 18(a) shows the F1 Score progression across FL rounds. Config. \ud835\udc34 maintains slightly better accuracy throughout the FL rounds, reaching a final F1 Score of 0.25 compared to 0.24 of the combined configuration. This suggests that the compression process may introduce a small degra- dation in model accuracy (Kairouz et al., 2021). Fig. 18(b) presents the total round time per FL round. While both configurations follow similar patterns, the combined approach shows a higher total round time, averaging about 500 s per round versus 490 s for Config. \ud835\udc34. Fig. 18(c) depicts the ratio between F1 Score and total round time. Config. \ud835\udc34 shows better efficiency across all rounds, indicating that the additional computational overhead from combining the Message Compressor with the Heterogeneous Data Handler outweighs any potential benefits in communication efficiency. We think that this experimental result is relevant, since it makes evident that it is not always beneficial to combine architectural patterns, there exist some interactions that do not lead to advantages, thus confirming the usefulness of a tool-based approach that quantifies the impact of different design alternatives.

Client selector and multi-task model trainer Table 8 shows our intent to compare two distinct architectural choices: the baseline configuration (Config. M3) implements the Multi- Task Model Trainer pattern only with a mixed client pool ( 4 clients per task: 2 with IID and 2 with non-IID data). The combined configuration applies both the Client Selector and the Multi-Task Model Trainer, filtering participants to select only those with IID data distributions while preserving the concurrent multi-task training capability. Rationale. The combination of the Client Selector and the Multi-Task Model Trainer patterns aims to support multi-task learning by ensuring that selected clients hold well-distributed data across all classes. This combination assumes that clients with IID data provide more stable and reliable contributions across multiple learning tasks, potentially leading to better convergence in the multi-task training process. Experiment. Fig. 19 shows the results comparing two architectural choices: (\ud835\udc56) the baseline configuration (M3) implementing only the Multi-Task Model Trainer with a heterogeneous client pool (2 IID and 2 non-IID), and (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) a combined configuration that integrates the Client Selector pattern with the baseline, which systematically filters partic- ipants to retain only those with IID data characteristics. Figs. 19(a) and 19(b) report the average training time per FL round for both tasks T1 and T2. The combined configuration with Client Selector shows consistently lower training times compared to the baseline Config. M3, particularly for T1 where the reduction is more pronounced. Fig. 19(c) depicts the F1 Score evolution across FL rounds, with the combined configuration achieving higher model convergence. Fig. 19(d) shows the MAE progression, where lower values indicate better predictive per- formance. Both configurations show decreasing error rates as training progresses, with the combined configuration showing better predictive performance in later rounds. Figs. 19(e) and 19(f) present efficiency metrics combining accuracy (F1 Score for T1, MAE for T2) over training time. It is worth remarking that the combined configuration achieves a higher efficiency in both tasks, thus assessing the positive impact of combining these patterns. 5. Discussion 5.1. Analysis of architectural patterns Heterogeneous Data Handler. It makes use of GAN-based data aug- mentation to enhance local client datasets, improving global model accuracy and reducing average round time (Lo et al., 2022). Balanc- ing datasets with high-quality synthetic samples mitigates the effects of non-IID data, reducing gradient variance and accelerating conver- gence (Lo et al., 2022). In addition, as practitioners note (Lo et al., 2022; Compagnucci et al., 2025b), training on non-IID datasets can significantly extend the training phase duration and overall FL round time. Our experiment confirms both these assumptions. Configurations with non-IID clients (Config. \ud835\udc35 and \ud835\udc36) demonstrate reduced global model accuracy and slower convergence, characterized by longer and inconsistent round times. In contrast, the Heterogeneous Data Handler (Config. \ud835\udc37) mitigates these challenges through GAN-based data aug- mentation, balancing local datasets and accelerating convergence (Lo et al., 2022). However, this design alternative introduces substantial computational overhead due to the time required for training the GAN. The process of generating and validating synthetic data demands sig- nificant computational resources, while potentially revealing sensitive information about client data distributions that could compromise the client privacy. Multi-Task Model Trainer. It provides the capability to train global models that can handle different yet related tasks simultaneously (Lo et al., 2022). In our implementation, clients participate in both clas- sification (T1) and regression (T2) tasks, demonstrating that shared data characteristics contribute to improved predictive performance for both global models while keeping training time reasonable. Although training global models separately may lead to a slightly shorter training time, employing the Multi-Task Model Trainer pattern results in higher accuracy for both models. This is due to the Multi-Task Learning approach that allows the model to learn shared representations across different but related tasks (Lo et al., 2022). When data distributions among clients are skewed, a single global model struggles to capture unique data patterns, especially with non-IID data (Li et al., 2020b; Yu et al., 2019). By incorporating clients with similar data characteristics, the global model can learn from a broader dataset, providing more samples for underrepresented classes and mitigating class imbalance. However, the Multi-Task Model Trainer pattern leads to a higher con- sumption of hardware resources. As shown in Fig. 17, the configuration The Journal of Systems & Software 232 (2026) 112655 13 I. Compagnucci et al. Fig. 18. Analysis of the Heterogeneous Data Handler Pattern Combined with the Message Compressor. where this pattern is enabled (Config. M3) exhibits significantly higher CPU usage (i.e., 44% on average) than other configurations without this patterns (i.e., M1 and M2, whose CPU utilization is 23% and 27% on average, respectively). This increase reflects the additional computational demand required to concurrently manage and aggregate training results from multiple tasks. Moreover, model portability is more complex, as each client may use a model tailored to its specific task. A robust and reliable implementation must carefully manage the aggregation of different model weights in the server (Lo et al., 2022). 5.2. Combining multiple architectural patterns Heterogeneous Data Handler and Message Compressor. The integration of the Heterogeneous Data Handler and the Message Compressor is ini- tially conceived to improve system efficiency by enhancing data quality and reducing the communication time. However, from combining these patterns, we learn that the overall system efficiency may decrease. Experimental results show lower efficiency compared to when the Het- erogeneous Data Handler is implemented in isolation. The additional processing time from data compression and the decreasing global model accuracy appear to offset advantages gained through improved data quality. The system performance degradation observed when combin- ing the Heterogeneous Data Handler with the Message Compressor can be attributed to the pipeline of sequential data transformation they introduce. GAN-based data augmentation operations, which are com- putationally intensive, may introduce significant system bottlenecks when followed by compression procedures. This experience points out the reason why the combination of design alternatives requires some cautious. The synthetic data generated to balance class distribu- tions is subsequently compressed, potentially degrading the statistical properties established during augmentation. This double transforma- tion introduces information loss that negatively impacts the model accuracy. Software architects should carefully evaluate combinations of data-processing patterns, as their cumulative effects can distort data characteristics, resulting in reduced model accuracy rather than improved system performance. Client Selector and Multi-Task Model Trainer. Combining Client Selec- tor with Multi-Task Model Trainer shows a successful synergy offering improved efficiency and enhanced model accuracy. By filtering out non-IID clients, the Client Selector reduces noise during gradient ag- gregation, leading to faster convergence, while the Multi-Task Model Trainer effectively leverages shared data across tasks. While using fewer total clients, the combined configuration achieves a slightly higher accuracy with significantly reduced training time. The impact of this combination stems from two complementary factors. First, the Client Selector eliminates clients with non-IID data, which typically have unbalanced datasets and slow down model convergence and learning. Second, the Multi-Task Model Trainer leverages shared data across tasks, thereby enriching the training set with additional data that may be missing in individual clients. This synergy not only reduces the computational overhead by limiting non-IID clients, it also enhances training effectiveness by ensuring a more balanced and comprehensive data distribution. 5.3. Integration with existing MLOps techniques Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is defined in the literature as a paradigm including a variegate set of aspects, such as best practices, The Journal of Systems & Software 232 (2026) 112655 14 I. Compagnucci et al. Fig. 19. Analysis of the Multi-Task Model Trainer Pattern Combined with the Client Selector. concepts, and development culture, that contribute to the implemen- tation, monitoring, deployment, and scalability of machine learning products (Kreuzberger et al., 2023). MLOps tools are reviewed by Recupito et al. (2022) that highlight some important features of interest. For instance, our approach is aligned with the so-called predictive performance monitoring feature, since it raises the need to control the model\u2019s predictive performance. Two further features that align with our research are: (i) open source, which ensures the software code is publicly accessible for use, mod- ification, and distribution; and (ii) scalability, which highlights the importance of monitoring the system performance to support reliable continuous delivery. MLOps pipelines are reviewed by Eken et al. (2024) who foresee automation as a crucial aspect in ML systems. Tasks such as data collec- tion, model building, deployment, and monitoring should be automated to minimize the need of human intervention. Pipeline management is recognized as a complex process, involving multiple triggers to initiate task execution. For example, training may be triggered when the predictive performance of a model declines (Eken et al., 2024). This highlights the importance of generating reports (as those provided in our approach) that offer insights on the status of the ML product throughout its development and operation. The MLOps lifecycle consists of managing multiple versions of experiments, datasets, models, and their associated metadata, and op- timizing workflows across these lifecycle stages is crucial (Eken et al., 2024). Our research methodology supports this optimization by lever- aging architectural patterns that facilitate the generation of multiple experiment versions. Resulting quantitative metrics are then used to compare a wide range of design alternatives. Our approach can be integrated with existing MLOps techniques (e.g., Kubeflow Bisong, 2019, Amazon SageMaker Liberty et al., 2020, or Metaflow Berberi et al., 2025) leveraging the simulation reports produced by AP4Fed. Our quantitative evaluation includes metrics that assess both system and predictive performance, making them valuable for analyzing ML products within existing tools and pipelines. 5.4. Threats to validity Besides inheriting limitations of architectural patterns and system performance analysis (Shokri et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2020), our The Journal of Systems & Software 232 (2026) 112655 15 I. Compagnucci et al. approach presents the following threats to validity (Wohlin et al., 2012). External validity. The generalization of our findings to different sce- narios cannot be ensured due to the constraints imposed by our experi- mental setup. For instance, the available hardware resources, limited by the number of physical processors, restrict the scale of client devices in our experiments. As a result, the quantitative analysis primarily reflects the behavior of a small client population, which may not capture complexities and interactions of large-scale FL systems. Despite these limitations, experimental outcomes offer meaningful insights into the potential applicability and scalability of the proposed methodology. In addition, AP4Fed enables the execution of large-scale experiments, of- fering high flexibility to the specific technical requirements of software architects aiming to emulate real FL settings. Internal validity. Settings and parameters adopted for our analysis may pose certain risks. First, the proposed evaluation metrics capture a limited set of FL characteristics, and the obtained results reflect that selection. As future work, we plan to extend the evaluation and include additional metrics to explore further aspects of FL systems. Second, our experiments use only image-based datasets, excluding tabular data. We acknowledge that this choice limits the applicability of our approach, as it remains unclear if implemented patterns perform similarly with other type of data. This also leads to questioning our findings, since they might be influenced by the specific pattern implementation. As future work, we aim to investigate data of different nature to study the flexibility of AP4Fed. Third, numerical values assigned to input parameters are selected to point out quantitative differences across architectural alternatives. For example, we adjust the data partitioning strategy (e.g., IID versus non-IID) among clients to evaluate the impact of the heterogeneous data handling mechanism. To mitigate misleading influences, we ensure consistent input settings across experiments for each pattern, allowing observed results to be reliably linked to spe- cific architectural decisions. However, determining accurate numerical values for input parameters is an ever existing challenge in system performance (Bondi, 2015) and other settings could be further in- vestigated. Accordingly, we provide publicly available instructions for setting up experiments and testing different configurations (Compag- nucci et al., 2025a). Additionally, AP4Fed empowers software architects by offering a user-friendly interface to modify parameters and tailor experiments to their specific requirements, thus enabling customization in running the system performance analysis. Construct validity, i.e., the statistical validity of experimental results is monitored by repeating all the experimental configurations 10 times. We show output metrics average and their 99% confidence intervals, thus to assess the accuracy of the presented numerical outcomes. 6. Related work Architectural Patterns. Our work builds on extensive research empha- sizing the significance of adopting architectural patterns in software system design (Martin, 2000; Bass et al., 2012; Wan et al., 2023; Meijer et al., 2024). In recent years, the software architecture community has increasingly enforce the adoption of patterns in ML systems (Washizaki et al., 2019; Bonawitz et al., 2019; Warnett and Zdun, 2022; Ntentos et al., 2024). Washizaki et al. (2019) conducted a study that classifies architectural patterns specifically designed for ML systems, offering developers a structured framework to identify and implement appropri- ate solutions. Their findings highlight the importance of systematically evaluating the system performance and predictive performance of these patterns, which represents the core focus of our research. Ntentos et al. (2024) present a qualitative study aimed at supporting architec- tural decision-making for training strategies in reinforcement learning systems. Practitioners\u2019 knowledge is exploited to derive established patterns and best practices, and ultimately formalize these insights into a reusable architectural design decision model. Warnett et al. (2025) investigate the impact of architectural design decisions within ML operations (MLOps), and a set of metrics is introduced to quantify the automation in such a context. Interestingly, the authors point out that the metrics are valuable to quantify the quality of MLOps systems whilst ensuring compliance with non-functional requirements, e.g., system performance as proposed in this paper. Leest et al. (2023) and Takeuchi et al. (2021) propose well-defined approaches to tackle practical design challenges in ML systems, further emphasizing the need for methodologies that bridge architectural design with real-world application requirements. Federated Learning. FL presents notable benefits over centralized ML, particularly in terms of system efficiency and privacy (Zhang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020a). However, this distributed approach also introduces new architectural challenges, especially in managing the complex interactions between servers and clients. To address these issues, recent studies by Lo et al. (2021) and Rajasekaran et al. (2024) have proposed a suite of architectural patterns that provide structured solutions to these challenges. Recent studies have begun integrating these architectural patterns highlighting the importance of structured approaches to enhance system robustness. Ma et al. (2021) introduce the Client Selector pattern by implementing an algorithm that priori- tizes clients based on computational capacity and network conditions, aiming to mitigate delays caused by slower clients while preserving model accuracy. Pavlidis et al. (2023) expand on client selection by introducing an algorithm that prioritizes clients based on computa- tional power and network conditions, aiming to reduce delays from slower clients while achieving good model accuracy. Chahoud et al. (2025) propose a mechanism that facilitates the establishment of a trust relationship between the server and the pool of eligible clients, while concurrently strengthening defenses against unauthorized data access or manipulation. Fan and Liu (2020) explore Heterogeneous Data handling techniques by implementing GANs within a FL system, thus addressing challenges like privacy and data heterogeneity. Unlike standard FL, this method synchronizes both weights and the interaction between generators and discriminators, enforcing confidentiality and preserving data quality. To the best of our knowledge, the closest related methodologies are discussed hereafter. Lai et al. (2022) introduce a FL benchmark engine. Unlike our research, their work focuses on creating a standardized benchmarking suite for FL systems without exploring the impact of architectural alternatives on system performance through empirical evaluation. Casalicchio et al. (2023) introduce a workbench platform designed to evaluate the system performance of Federated Learning systems, incorporating patterns described in Lo et al. (2022). While this work was initially considered for comparison, the absence of re- producible experimental instructions and the lack of accessibility to the proposed tool prevent any meaningful correlation with our approach. In summary, existing studies primarily focus on introducing ar- chitectural patterns for FL systems, emphasizing only their potential advantages. Our work advances the state-of-the-art by proposing a methodology that not only evaluates the impact of these architectural alternatives on system performance and predictive performance, but also provides insights about their combined usage. To this end, we introduce AP4Fed, a benchmark framework that enable software ar- chitects to design and analyze FL systems adopting one or multiple architectural patterns. Its strengths include a modular design that sim- plifies the integration of architectural patterns and a GUI that makes building configurations straightforward, even for complex setups. 7. Conclusion This paper presents AP4Fed, a publicly available benchmark frame- work to quantitatively evaluate FL systems through the integration of six architectural patterns. AP4Fed provides a versatile platform that enables software architects to emulate realistic FL systems and assess the impact of architectural alternatives derived from the literature (Lo et al., 2022) and considered relevant for system performance and The Journal of Systems & Software 232 (2026) 112655 16 I. Compagnucci et al. predictive performance. Our findings suggest that architectural patterns are promising solutions for addressing FL design challenges. However, their adoption involves trade-offs, as the predictive performance im- provements come with an additional overhead that varies depending on the specific pattern. For instance, the Heterogeneous Data Handler reduces training time and increases model accuracy by utilizing GAN- based data augmentation to balance non-IID client datasets, thereby minimizing gradient variance and enhancing global model conver- gence. The Multi-Task Model Trainer pattern improves global model accuracy by leveraging shared data characteristics across separated but related tasks. In addition, the combination of multiple architectural patterns requires thorough analysis, as they may interact in unexpected ways, potentially introducing system performance drawbacks in the FL system. Analyzing these interactions helps the identification of trade- offs and optimization of overall FL system performance and predictive performance. In future work, a primary activity will be devoted to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed framework, thus understanding at which extent it supports software architects. To this end, we plan to define a user study by which software architects can express their opinions. This is of key relevance, since we can use the feedback to further improve our framework. Besides, we plan to extend AP4Fed by considering further evaluation metrics, e.g., software/hardware failures for system reliability. As another example, security flaws may be detected in data since clients may be exposed to attacks, and it may be relevant to detect data poisoning. Furthermore, we plan to test additional datasets, mainly exploring tabular formats, since they may contribute to different findings.

Business processes require continuous changes or interven- tions to remain efficient and competitive over time. However, implement- ing these changes\u2014such as reordering or adding new tasks\u2014 can neg- atively affect the overall process performance. A longstanding problem in Business Process Management is that of forecastingex-ante the val- ues that process performance measures will assume after implementing changes. To achieve this, the concept of Digital Process Twins, which extends the well-established Digital Twin paradigm, paves the way for new interesting opportunities. Digital Process Twins enable enhanced what-if analysis by virtually predicting process performance under vari- ous changes, thus allowing for informed decision-making before actuating process changes in the real world. However, despite recognition as one of the new key enablers of modern process re-engineerization, a compre- hensive approach to implementing Digital Process Twins is still lacking. This paper proposes a novel conceptual architecture for deploying Digital Process Twins to address this gap. Additionally, we introduceDolly, a framework that implements such conceptual architecture using a multi- modeling approach combining domain data and process modeling along with a data-driven process simulation technique. Keywords: Business Process\u00b7 Digital Process Twin\u00b7 Internet of Things 1 Introduction Nowadays, organizations constantly strive to enhance and sustain the efficiency and performance of their operational processes [16]. This necessity is fueled by several factors, including the increasing competitiveness of the global market, environmental shifts, variations in resource availability, emergent business op- portunities, and the advent of new technologies [15]. A notable example of these advancements is the emerging field of IoT-Enhanced Business Processes [8,9,33], 2 I. Compagnucci et al. where IoT devices are increasingly being integrated into processes to optimize further and automate business operations. However, for a long time, a problem in the field of Business Process Management is that ofwhat-if process analysis: predicting the values that one or more process performance measures will assume after a given business process changes or interventions [4,15,18]. A similar problem has been addressed in mechanical and industrial engineer- ing using the Digital Twin paradigm. Digital Twins are virtual replicas of real- world systems synchronized at specific levels of detail. They accurately predict the performance and behavior of their physical counterparts over time, offering valuable insights for optimization and decision-making [19]. Initially adopted in the manufacturing sector to virtually replicate, simulate, and predict the perfor- mance of physical machines, the concept of Digital Twin is starting to be applied to organizational processes, providing a new approach to re-engineering modern business processes [15,18]. Gartner estimates that by 2026, 25% of global enter- prises will move towards creating Digital Twins for their business processes [22]. In light of this, the integration of Business Process Management practices with the Digital Twin paradigm is being seen as a promising solution for helping organizations manage process changes while maintaining resilience and control over their operations [4,15,18]. Just as traditional Digital Twins replicate and predict the performance of physical assets, Digital Process Twins offer analogous capabilities for business processes. Implementing changes in business processes typically involves significant time, resources and risk of failure, leading to high expenses [16]. This integration facilitateswhat-if process analysis, allowing or- ganizations to simulate potential changes and predict their impact on process performance ex-ante in a virtual, safe, and risk-free environment [15,18,25]. However, despite being recently recognized as a key enabler for digital trans- formation in organizational processes [4,15,25], there is currently no detailed framework for fully exploiting the opportunities that a Digital Process Twin can provide [18]. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, we propose a novel concep- tual architecture for implementing Digital Process Twins. The proposed archi- tecture employs heterogeneous digital models and Business Process Management techniques to replicate theas-is process and reason about the performance of a to-be process after virtually implementing process changes. Secondly, we present Dolly, a framework that implements the proposed Digital Process Twin\u2019s con- ceptual architecture.Dolly uses a multi-modeling approach that combines an IoT domain model with the MERODE methodology and BPMN, enabling the simulation and prediction of process changes\u2019 impact on performance before real- world implementation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents background knowledge. Section 3 presents a conceptual architecture for implementing Digital ProcessTwins.Section4introducesthe DollyframeworksupportingtheDigital ProcessTwinconceptualarchitectureinpractice.Section5reportsonthe Dolly evaluation. Finally, Section 6 discusses related works, and Section 7 summarizes and concludes the paper. A DPT Conceptual Architecture for What-If Process Analysis 3 2 Background This section overviews the most relevant aspects of deploying the Digital Process Twin. First, we introduce MERODE, a model-driven method used to support the design of digital models for Digital Process Twin. Additionally, we discuss the Business Process Simulation technique, which is fundamental for conducting \u201cwhat-if\u201d analyses and estimating business process performance. 2.1 The MERODE Methodology Adopting a Model-Driven Engineering approach in developing Digital Twins is fundamental to fully leverage their potential [19,24]. A noteworthy approach within this domain is the MERODE methodology [31]. MERODE uses object- oriented domain modeling to develop enterprise information systems, structuring the design and implementation of intra-organizational enterprise information systems into three distinct layers: the Domain layer, the Information System Services layer, and the Business Process layer [31]. The Domain layer definesbusiness objects, including their attributes andrela- tionships. A business object represents a real-world entity relevant to a business process, such as data, documents, people, events, or other elements participating in a business process [16]. Examples of business objects could includeContainer and Shipment, which can be instantiated to link a container with a specific shipment. Additionally, aSensor equipped on each container constantly mon- itors and tracks data in real-time, providing comprehensive information about the shipment\u2019s status and conditions. The domain layer enables code genera- tion from a conceptual model named \u201cMERODE Domain Model\u201d, facilitating the transition to a functional prototype of the information system [30,31]. The MERODE Domain Model consists of three views: aClass Diagram, an Object Event Table, and a set ofFinite State Machines. The class diagram defines busi- ness objects and their relationships, while the object event table maps event types triggered by business objects. When an event fires, it triggers the exe- cution of methods on business objects used to create, modify, or end business object instances. Finite state machines specify the life cycles of business objects, depicting object behavior triggered by events. A MERODE Domain model can be modeled using the MERLIN Modeling Tool4, providing model consistency and correctness assessment features. The Information System Services layer acts as a bridge between business objects and business processes. Input services update the business objects by modifying their attributes or state, while output services provide access to data. The Business Process layer sits above the Information System Services layer. Its purpose is to facilitate interactions between processes and the Domain layer via Information System Services, ensuring the update and exchange of informa- tion with business objects. 4 https://www.merlin-academic.com/ 4 I. Compagnucci et al. 2.2 Data-Driven Business Process Simulation Traditional Business Process Simulations allow business experts to estimate the performance of business processes under varying conditions and constraints [1]. To run a simulation, a Simulation Model is required. This model digitally repli- cates real-world processes, including detailed mappings of process flows, activi- ties, decision points, and resources. In addition, it necessitates a set of Simula- tion Parameters that represent quantitative variables such as activity processing times and costs used to ensure that the Simulation Model accurately reflects real-world conditions [1,28]. However, the manual creation and fine-tuning of Business Simulation Models is an error-prone task, involving a complex set of models and parameters defined and assessed manually by business experts. This approach often leads to inaccurate models and requires significant time to iden- tify the optimal scenario for desired performance outcomes [6,14]. Data-driven process simulation offers a solution by leveraging real data to discover accurate and enhanced simulation-ready models [6,14]. Unlike tradi- tional process simulations, which rely on manually gathered and interpreted information, data-driven simulations utilize historical and real-time data from event logs. Mining techniques based on past event logs of the process [6,23] are employed to ensure that simulation-ready models and parameters are reason- able and aligned with reality [1]. Historical data provide retrospective insights through process mining techniques, while real-time data enable continuous up- dates to the simulation model, ensuring it accurately reflects the current state of the process during the simulation [14]. Once the simulation model is configured, it is ready to be simulated, and results can be interpreted. To this end, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are crucial for evaluating the performance and effectiveness of business processes. KPIs are values for measuring the effectiveness in achieving specific goals of a business process [1]. They include metrics such as cycle time distribution, waiting time distribution, cost distribution, and resource utilization, providing benchmarks for evaluating overall process performance. By assessing the KPIs, the what-if questions mentioned above can be answered, and different process redesigns can be compared. 3 Conceptualizing Digital Twins Implementing a Digital Twin infrastructure is a non-trivial task [19,26]. Despite the emergence of various implementations from both research and practical ap- plications [17,26], no single solution can be considered a silver bullet for imple- menting a full-fledged Digital Twin [19]. A Digital Twin environment typically includes a collection of interconnected models and data that replicate a real- world system [19]. It provides services, including design, development, analysis, simulation, and optimization, enabling a thorough understanding and enhance- ment of the replicated system\u2019s performance [17,19]. A DPT Conceptual Architecture for What-If Process Analysis 5 3.1 A Conceptual Architecture for Digital Twin In [17], the authors explored various characterizations of the core elements of Digital Twins. This effort was directed at providing a clearer understanding of the foundational components of Digital Twins. They proposed a generic and con- ceptual architecture for facilitating the systematic engineering of new domain- independent Digital Twin applications. According to [17], a Digital Twin adheres to a three-component architecture described as a three-element tuple: ADT = \u27e8Actual System, Models, Data\u27e9 Where the Actual System represent a real-world system or object;Models providedigitalrepresentationsoftheActualSystem;and Data representscurrent and historical data of the Actual System, crucial for instantiating digital models. The three main components of the architecture are described in the follows. \u2013 The Actual Systemrefers to the real-world system that the Digital Twin aims to replicate. It involves collecting, storing, calculating, and inferring data specific to the system. These activities are essential for the Digital Twin to capture relevant aspects, features, and relationships of the Actual System within its operational contexts and environments. \u2013 The Data component is about storing and representing current and histor- ical data from the Actual System. Data and information are important to accurately provides information to models and reflect the actual system in the digital space of the Digital Twin environment, enabling accurate and fair analysis. \u2013 The Models establish digital representations of the Actual System consid- ering different perspectives. As stated by [17], it includes three types of mod- els: descriptive, predictive, andprescriptive. Descriptive modelscapture and organize data to accurately replicate the Actual System.Predictive models support decision-making using aggregated data and insights from descriptive models to anticipate future system behavior and conduct \u201cwhat-if\u201d analyses. Finally,Prescriptive modelsincorporate insights from \u201cwhat-if\u201d analyses into adaptive actions aimed at optimizing the Actual System. 3.2 A Conceptual Architecture for Digital Process Twin Digital Process Twins have recently been acknowledged as crucial enablers for digital transformation within organizational processes [4,15,18]. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive implementations to effectively leverage the Digital Process Twins paradigm. In the following, we propose a conceptual architectural approach tailored for the engineering and deployment of Digital Process Twins, drawing upon the conceptualization outlined in the previous Subsection. Figure 1 depicts a visual representation of the proposed conceptual architecture. The Actual System here refers to a business process, which consists of actions, events, and decisions that lead to creating a service or product [16]. Typically, business processes encompass various perspectives, which the authors in [27] categorize into six distinct perspectives described in the following. 6 I. Compagnucci et al.

Process-Aware Information Systems integrate and manage these business processes by incorporating the aforementioned perspectives, facilitating control, monitoring, and analysis [27]. The information generated by these systems pro- vide valuable information and data on various aspects of the process. These systems generate valuable information, including historical data stored in event logs and real-time data on ongoing process instances, which offer essential infor- mation for creating a digital process replica. The Data component entails collecting and storing process-relevant data di- rectly from the process and the Process-Aware Information System. Data are organized through Digital Shadows, which are abstracted and aggregated data structures that provide a one-way data flow from the Actual System to its digital representation [3,25]. Information is transmitted to the Digital Shadow to es- tablish a synchronous linkage between the Actual System and its corresponding Digital Process Twin. Data is fundamental for two reasons: first, it instantiates digital models that accurately replicate the Actual System; second, by populat- ing these models, it enables detailed analyses that provide insights and drive A DPT Conceptual Architecture for What-If Process Analysis 7 improvements in the Actual System. The data flow, represented in Figure 1 by the \u201cMonitoring/Mining\u201d arrow, illustrates two methods of data collection: real-time monitoring of ongoing business process instances and historical data extraction using Process Mining techniques [2]. Real-time data includes infor- mation about the current status of the process (i.e., resource usage, active tasks, actual process KPIs). Historical data, including event logs of past process execu- tions, organizational documents outlining procedures, and additional contextual data, provides valuable information for Process Mining analyses [2]. Considering theModel component, descriptive modelsaim to create a digi- tal replica of the process [17]. Therefore, the first step is defining a model able to properly represent the actual business process embedding the six typical perspec- tives of business processes described below. Ensuring the quality of the process model is crucial, because it enables precise monitoring, analysis, and optimiza- tionofbusinessprocesses,leadingtoimprovedefficiency,predictivemaintenance, and informed decision-making [16,35]. In this context, Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) stands out as the most common and effective standard for designing a business process model for organizations [10,11]. A BPMN dia- gram details the sequence of activities, control rules, and interactions between process participants, providing a clear and comprehensive representation of the entire process. It represents specificbehaviors, functions, operations, organiza- tional and time perspectives of the process. The model of the process is obtained by adopting process mining discovery algorithms [2], which analyze event logs from the Process-Aware Information System to ensure the model is accurate and reflects reality. In parallel, the domain data model manages theinformation perspective, organizing and structuring data relevant to the process. This in- cludes class diagrams and finite state machines that define the relationships and states of business objects, ensuring data integrity and supporting the retrieval of process-related information. To conduct what-if analyses, a predictive model representing the digital replica of the actual business process is employed. However, to implement and test new process changes, business experts must manually adjust the process structure (i.e., reordering tasks and adding new resources). For this reason, the digital replica should be modified by (i) manually implementing the necessary changes to the process model; (ii) discovering optimalSimulation Parameters using existing mining approaches on historical data [6,23]; (iii) leveraging real- time data from a Domain Model [27]. This enables the creation of a data-driven process simulation model, allowing for the virtual implementation of changes and the estimation of the new process\u2019s performance through simulation. Fi- nally, simulation insights can be translated into the form ofPrescriptive Models. They consist of estimating KPIs and analyzing event logs to reason about the impact of changes made to the process. These insights are translated into ac- tions, evaluated by business experts, and, if beneficial, implemented in the actual business process. To complete the feedback loop between the Digital Twin and the Actual System, the \u201cActuating\u201d arrow involves implementing and executing 8 I. Compagnucci et al. actions on the Actual System based on prescriptive models. This approach helps reduce costs, save time, and provide a risk-free environment for virtual testing. 4 Dolly: A Framework for Implementing Digital Process Twins This section introducesDolly, a framework based on the Digital Process Twin conceptual architecture proposed in Subsection 3.2 It adopts a multi-modeling approach,integratingdomaindatamodelsformalizedwiththeMERODEmethod- ology, the standard BPMN language for process modeling, and data-driven sim- ulation techniques for what-if process analysis. Figure 2 provides an overview of Dolly, highlighting its three key components: the Actual System, Data, and Models.

Descriptive Models - MERODE Domain Model; - Process Model BPMN (P1); - Actual KPIs Estimation.Prescriptive Models - Simulation Reports; - KPIs Estimation; Fig.2: Dolly: Framework Overview. To create a digital copy of theActual Process(P1), Dolly allows to lever- age data from the Process-Aware Information System that implements the ac- tual business process. TheData extracted includes real-time information from ongoing process instances via an embedded Camunda Engine, as well as his- torical data obtained by uploading an event log representing previous process executions. The event log is used to discover the structure of the actual BPMN process model(P1) through Process Mining techniques [2]. On the other hand, Real-time data are used to instantiate the MERODE Domain Model. In [32], the authors demonstrate how MERODE bridges the gap between data and pro- cess modeling by linking these two domains formally. It allows the handling of A DPT Conceptual Architecture for What-If Process Analysis 9 domain process data by continuously monitoring business objects\u2019 status, rela- tionships, actions, and actual process KPIs. This enables real-time management of their data, providing current status information within the process. Moreover, MERODE supports formal verification, reusability, and flexibility [31], creating descriptive models that reflect business processes from multiple perspectives. Then, to evaluate the impact of potential process changes, a new BPMN model (P1\u2019) is derived by modifying the digital counterpartP1 of the actual pro- cess. UnlikeP1, theP1\u2019 model necessitate additional features. First, it includes manual changes applied by business experts, implementing the desired changes to the process. Additionally, to effectively run simulations,P1\u2019 requires defining simulation parameters. These parameters are discovered using SimuBridge [23], whichallowsminingtechniquestobeperformedonhistoricalprocessdata,ensur- ing that simulations are based on real information. Furthermore,P1\u2019 integrates real-time data from the MERODE Domain Model, aligning domain data with the current state of the ongoing process instance. This real-time data is essential for maintaining the accuracy and relevance of the simulations. By simulating P1\u2019, which acts as apredictive model, it is possible to conduct \u201cwhat-if\u201d analysis within the Digital Process Twin, allowing for the evaluation of potential changes and providing valuable insights into their impact before real-world implemen- tation. To run simulations on BPMN models,Dolly embedded BIMP UI, a business process simulator. This integration allows users to simulate business processes effectively, leveraging a user-friendly interface to visualize, analyze, and download simulation results. Business experts then evaluate the impact of the changes on process perfor- mance by carefully analyzing the simulation results. If the performance improves or remains unchanged, the changes suggested by the prescriptive models can be considered for implementation. If performance does not improve,P1\u2019 is revised andtestedagain.Thisiterativeapproachenablescontinuousprocessadjustments based on real-time data, simulation feedback, and desired process changes. 5 Framework Evaluation This section presents a real-world implementation ofDolly in a smart har- bor scenario. The objective is to evaluate the framework\u2019s capabilities. A smart harbor represents a technologically advanced port that leverages innovative tech- nologies and data-driven solutions to enhance operational efficiency [29]. This scenario focuses on an IoT-enabled business process that represents modern pro- cesses designed for automation through IoT integration. While smart harbors encompass various processes, we will focus on container dispatching. 5.1 The Container Dispatch Business Process Context. The process starts with the arrival of a cargo container at the har- bor and ends when it is loaded onto a cargo ship, indicating that it\u2019s ready for shipment. The containers involved in dispatching are equipped with IoT devices 10 I. Compagnucci et al. (i.e., RFID sensors) to track their status during the dispatching. When contain- ers reach the harbor, their information (i.e., IoT data and shipping documents) is recorded in the system and transmitted to the Storage Area. Then, it is re- located to the Control Area for quality inspection. Quality control is conducted by cross-referencing the container\u2019s arrival data with the information gathered during manual quality inspection. If the container fails the quality test, a man- ual inspection is conducted to address potential quality issues, and the container is then returned to the Storage Area. Once quality problems are resolved, the container is moved to the Shipping Area and loaded onto the cargo ship.

Process Data. The event logs were generated considering two primary data sources: (i) logs from the smart harbor system, which contains the sequences of activities performed for each process instance and trace attributes, and (ii) IoT sensor data, which tracks the arrival and quality of the containers considering temperature and humidity. The process event logs were generated using CDLG [20], a tool specifically designed to create synthetic event logs integrating concept drifts and noise, such as missing event data. Event logs are based on patterns and data observed in real-life operations from the Tuscan Port Community System 5. The event log comprises 7 activities, 3 resources, 33,910 events related to 5000 cases, and 67 execution paths (process variants). 5 https:/tpcs.tpcs.eu/ A DPT Conceptual Architecture for What-If Process Analysis 11 5.2 Use Case Instantiation Actual Business Process.As a first step, we employed the inductive miner process mining algorithm to discover the actual business processP1 from the event log, applying a threshold to mitigate noise. The process structure has been slightly adapted to better align with real-world operations. Figure 3a depicts the process model discovered (P1). Automated tasks are designated as service tasks, whilethemanualtaskofresolvingqualityproblemsisidentifiedasamanualtask. Additionally, a data object has been incorporated to represent IoT data utilized during container registration and quality check activities. The initial container registration in the system involves capturing this IoT data, which is crucial for subsequent quality assessments. Analysis of the structure of the event log and the derived process is provided through a python notebook6. MERODE Domain Model.In [12], we utilized a MERODE Domain Model to develop a Digital Twin for manufacturing applications. Building on this, we have implemented the domain model withinDolly to generatePrescriptive Models for implementing Digital Process Twins. After discovering the actual process, the MERODE Domain Model is instan- tiated and mapped to the business objects participating. For example, creating instances of theDevice class allows real-time retrieval of data, status, and ac- tions from physical devices. These digital models, formed by class diagrams, finite state machines and object event tables, are dynamically synchronized with business objects at the business process level, capturing real-time and histori- cal data. Each business object is \u201ctracked\u201d by these models, and every action it performs is updated both in the process and in the domain model instances. This ensures that both real-time and past data produced by business objects can be retrieved for analysis. A representation of the MERODE Domain Model is shown in Figure 4. Further details on the specification and instantiation of the MERODE IoT Domain Model are available online7. Data-Driven Process Simulation.At this stage, we assumed the involve- ment of business experts to introduce changes to the actual process. For this use case, we address the question:How can we modify the process to reduce total costs and cycle time while maintaining the same operational efficiency? Using bpmn.io, a BPMN modeler embedded inDolly, changes were manu- ally applied to the digital process replica (P1), resulting in an adapted version, P1\u2019. This adaptation aimed to simplify the workflow, reduce costs, and shorten the process cycle time. InP1\u2019, the container is moved to the Control Area only if it fails the quality check, eliminating unnecessary movements. Figure 3c depicts the adapted version of the processP1\u2019.

It leverages the Simod mining algorithm [7], which enhances accuracy to derive models and simulation parameters from event logs. The simulation parameters mined are as follows: Worker 1 handles container sys- tem registration and quality checks, earning\u20ac20 per hour; Worker 2 manages container movements, earning\u20ac30 per hour; Worker 3 performs manual quality inspections, earning\u20ac25 per hour. Figure 3b shows these parameters, with each task differentiated by shapes and colors based on the resource associated. For all workers, a 24/7 working timetable was considered. Activities have varying durations: the container quality check takes 1 hour while recording and checking container data in the system takes 5 minutes. To better reflect reality, container movements follow a uniform time distribution, varying between 25 and 35 min- utes. Containers have an 84% chance of passing the quality test, as required by the XOR gateway for outgoing sequence flows (84% OK, 16% NOT OK). Additionally, a fixed distribution time is assigned to each instance\u2019s arrival. Finally, we simulatedP1\u2019 using BIMP UI, a scalable and fast BPMN simula- torandcomparedtheKPIsderivedfrom P1 andP1\u2019.AsmotivatedbytheDigital Process Twin architecture, we employed a hybrid approach integrating mined op- timal simulation parameters, real-time data from the MERODE Domain Model, and manual changes to the actual processP1.

Significant research has focused on implementing Digital Twins in industrial sectors, particularly in replicating and simulating machines and devices used in manufacturing processes [3,24,26]. Despitethegrowinginterest,onlyalimitednumberofresearchworksfocuson implementing Digital Process Twins. For instance, [34] proposes a micro-service 8 https://bit.ly/Dolly_AnalisysResults_ipynb 9 https://zenodo.org/records/12671621 10 https://github.com/IvanComp/Dolly 14 I. Compagnucci et al. architecture to integrate physical IoT entities into IoT-Enhanced Business Pro- cesses. This approach uses a model-driven development method that combines BPMN models and Digital Twins Definition Language models via Java micro- services, allowing IoT virtual replicas to be integrated into real-world processes. However, it lacks capabilities for continuous optimization and adaptation of IoT- Enhanced Business Processes. Similarly, PROWIN [13] is a framework designed for monitoring and executing IoT-Enhanced Business Processes in a multi-robot scenario. It uses the Gazebo Simulator for 3D visualization of the operating scenario and the process\u2019s evolution, offering a detailed view of the system\u2019s ex- ecution. Nonetheless, it does not address the specifics of the software infrastruc- ture needed for maintaining runtime synchronization with the real world. In [5], authors present a framework for managing IoT-Enhanced Business Processes. This solution extends the BPMN standard and integrates models for analysis, featuring a model-to-text transformation engine, an interaction broker for IoT infrastructure, a simulation engine, and a business process engine. However, it lacks detailed real-time communication with physical counterparts. This work advances the state of the art by proposing a novel conceptual architecture for deploying Digital Process Twins. It outlines a procedure for creating, managing, and simulating digital replicas of business processes to assess potential changes before real-world implementation. Additionally, we introduce Dolly, a prototype framework that allows to implementation of the proposed Digital Process Twin conceptual architecture. 7 Conclusion In this paper, we moved a first step in introducing a novel conceptual architec- ture for deploying Digital Process Twins to enhance resilient process changes and support informed decision-making through predictive insights derived from data-driven process simulations. The architecture integrates heterogeneous digi- tal models (e.g., descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive) to design, synchronize, and simulate a high-fidelity digital replica of business processes, leveraging data extracted from real-time business object monitoring and process mining analysis. The conceptual architecture promotes a feedback loop mechanism that uti- lizes data-driven process simulation on the process replica to continuously assess thepotentialimpactsofdesiredprocesschanges.Ifprocessperformanceimproves or remains stable, these changes are considered to be actuated by business ex- perts in the real-world process. Moreover, conducting tests on digital replicas en- ables secure, risk-free evaluation of changes, thereby reducing deployment costs and accelerating process updates. The approach was evaluated usingDolly, an early-prototype framework implementing the proposed Digital Process Twins ar- chitecture in the context of a container dispatching process, revealing significant improvements. In future research, we aim to improve furtherDolly, currently in its proto- type stage, focusing on performance in high data volume environments, such as A DPT Conceptual Architecture for What-If Process Analysis 15 typical IoT settings. We also plan to testDolly in more complex and larger- scale scenarios for more accurate and realistic evaluation. References 1. van der Aalst, W.M.P.: Business Process Simulation Survival Guide.

However, the development of DTs pose significant challenges, particularly on the modeling and data management aspects. This paper presents a holistic approach to develop a DT implementation using a domain model derived from the standard SSN/SOSA ontologies. The proposed approach leverages the MERODE modeling method for rapid prototyping and valida- tion, guaranteeing robust model quality checks and enabling the creation of flexible and reusable code adaptable to different architectural settings. Data management is enhanced through the use of the SOSA/SSN ontology, enabling semantic data models and inference strategies to achieve semantic interoperability. By combining MERODE and IoT ontologies, our approach aims to take a step forward in addressing the challenges linked to system complexity and data management in the development of DT. The proposed approach was validated by instantiating the proposed model with a real-life case.

I NTRODUCTION & MOTIVATION Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged as a prominent concept, representing a new paradigm in the field of smart systems engineering. A DT refers to a virtual replica or simulation of a physical object, process, or system that enables real-time monitoring, analysis, predictive maintenance, and optimization [18]. It offers enhanced system management capabilities by leveraging real-time data obtained from the components of the system. Demonstrating their efficacy across many application domains, DTs have established themselves as an indispens- able element within the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) field [4]. Moreover, adopting a Model-Driven Engi- neering (MDE) approach in the development of DT, is crucial to fully leverage their potential [19]. While the benefits of DT have been demonstrated in many areas, their development, operation, and evolution pose signif- icant challenges. In fact, at present, no tool or platform can fully support the development of a DT [13]. The development of digital twin-based systems requires a holistic systems en- gineering approach where the modeling and data management aspects are critical [18]. Considering the complexity of IoT systems, maintaining a consistent system structure is a non- trivial task. Part of such an issue can be addressed from the perspective of MDE [1] using ad-hoc domain models. These models act as the foundational building blocks for developing robust information systems, providing a solid foundation for capturing and organizing domain-specific knowledge [11]. In this paper, to facilitate the holistic development of a DT for an IoT system, we have derived a domain model based on a standard IoT ontology. The domain model has been designed to be integrated as a module within \u201cregular\u201d information systems, so as to facilitate enriching these systems with DT features. We adopt the MERODE modeling method, which enables rapid prototyping and validation of the model using real-life cases. MERODE further offers the advantages of thorough model quality checks, and a layered approach which allows for the required flexibility and reusability of the code in different architectural settings [15]. From the data management perspective, ontologies offer a relevant approach to achieving semantic interoperability, as they enable the definition of semantic data models combined with domain knowledge, as well as the formulation of inference strategies [8], [11]. By leveraging the advantages offered by combining MERODE and IoT ontologies, our intention is to move a step forward in addressing the system complexity and data management challenges involved in the development of IoT systems and the corresponding DT. The paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we present a background on MDE and data management in DTs. The section concludes with an analysis of some standard ontologies for the IoT. Section III provides an overview of the research methodology. Section IV briefly introduces the MERODE approach. Section V presents the development of a DT by combining MERODE and the SSN/SOSA ontology. In Section VI we present the evaluation of the approach based on a real-world use case. Finally, in Section VII, we present the conclusions and future work. II. B ACKGROUND & RELATED WORK This section presents the evolution of modeling in sys- tems engineering from craft-based development to the new paradigm of DTs. Then, it provides an overview of relevant works that have explored the application of data management techniques for IoT. Finally, we will discuss two of the most important ontologies for IoT, namely the Semantic Sensor 1 Network (SSN) and the Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) Ontology. A. Model-Driven Engineering in Digital Twins In the context of DT, MDE aims to create a system that effectively captures the behavior, structure and relationships of IoT system components [2]. By representing the digital version of the IoT system through a model, it is possible to simulate, analyze and optimize the system\u2019s performance without directly manipulating the physical system itself. A study from [18] explored the evolution and adoption of mod- eling in systems engineering from craft-based development to the adoption of more sophisticated models as DTs. In this subsection, we present an adapted perspective on this study by shifting the focus towards the development of software systems, rather than physical artifacts. Figure 1 shows the evolution of modeling and engineering applied to DT. In the early days of craft-based software development, peo- ple relied on practical knowledge and trial-and-error to develop software solutions. As complexity increased and communi- cation became important, model-based development emerged, using sketches and designs to guide production. The adoption of MBSE improved product quality and communication within development teams, facilitating advancements in engineering [18]. However, using sketch and blueprint models does not allow to create a strong and formal link between the model, a physical object and its digital representation. Model-driven engineering uses executable models to au- tomatically generate software and/or digital objects without human intervention. The models thus establish a formal link between the design and the generated software [18]. This approach allows for easy updates and adaptations by modi- fying the model rather than the software directly. In MDE, models are used as blueprints for software development and they rely on a Metamodel which defines the vocabulary used in the input models (i.e., abstract syntax, concrete syntax, well-formedness rules, and semantics). The MDE process involves the generation of multiple intermediate models using generators, which are then utilized to produce a final artifact (i.e., software and/or digital objects). With model-driven engineering, the connection between the model and the physical artefact is typically lost once the physical artifact is modified. As a result, the software that represents the physical artifact does not remain synchronized with it. In recent years, the concept of the DT has emerged to address this limitation [18]. DT represents a next stage, where the physical object is continuously connected to its digital counterpart throughout the entire lifecycle. A key concern in DT is ensuring the continuous near-real-time synchronization of the state between the DT and the physical artifact. This enables a consistent and up-to-date representation between a tangible entity and its digital replica facilitating real-time monitoring, simulation, and testing of the entity\u2019s performance. As a result, this integration empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions and drive operational optimization by harnessing the insights derived from the DT. B. Data Management in Digital Twins According to [17], a DT adheres to a five-component architecture described as a five-element tuple: MDT = \u27e8P E, V E, Service, Data, Connection\u27e9 Where PE represents a Physical Entity of the real world; VE the corresponding Virtual Entity; Service the operations provided for both entities; Data the information produced, processed, and exchanged between these elements, and Con- nection indicates how the parties are linked. Figure 2 depicts a visual representation of these five dimensions. The Data component serves as a point of ingestion of the original data from these systems and of return at the right time to direct the interactive optimization process resulting from the interaction between them [5]. Often, in DT systems, real-time data is extracted from sensors or actuators which are associated with the Physical Entity component. The corresponding Virtual Entity is then defined as a model that virtually replicate the characteristics and behavior of the Physical Entity. However, achieving a consistent mechanism for managing data across DT systems is a non-trivial task. In 2022, a systematic literature review on data management solutions in the DT context was published [5]. This review analyzes challenges and key points about data in the context of DTs identifying issues, trends, and opportunities. According to [5], there are five well-known challenges that a DT system should properly address in the context of data management. Providing Data integration is required to combine data from multiple sources to provide a high-level unified view that makes the data available for analysis and use. Support for Data heterogeneity is required because of the significant semantic, terminological, and syntactic differences across dif- ferent application domains. Data Interoperability is required to make data accessible, reusable, and understandable by all entities involved in the system. Finally, data should be easily accessible ( Data Search) and trustworthy ( Data Quality) so that value can be derived from it. The survey shows that dealing with data integration, hetero- geneity, interoperability, search, and quality are common is- sues observed in developing MDE systems for DTs. Moreover, the study highlights that the maturity level of data management solutions remains at an early stage, necessitating substantial efforts for enhancement. In light of this, in [5], authors propose several techniques to address, at least partially, the challenges associated with data management in the DT context. Adopting a reference archi- tecture that organizes data/information into distinct abstraction layers can enhance the quality of raw data. By leveraging the concept of \u201cseparation of concerns\u201d, providing high-quality data can be facilitated. Therefore, it is logical to seek a solution based on a well-defined conceptual modeling method- ology, such as MERODE.

The utilization of a standardized ontology for representing entities in the context of DTs, such as sensors, power plants, and manufacturing, can effectively mitigate semantic heterogeneity, ensuring consistent comprehension of different or similar concepts regardless of modeling disparities [5]. Furthermore, ontologies enable a shared understanding and interconnectedness of concepts across various domains or disciplines, facilitating the Data Interoperabilityof DTs [12]. C. Ontologies for the Internet of Things One of the most important aspects to develop DT is the capacity to mirror and interact with the physical environment. For that, IoT technology is essential, being the link between the physical and the digital world. Several ontologies have been developed to conceptualize and represent IoT. A well- known and generally accepted ontology for IoT, is the Seman- tic Sensor Network (SSN) Ontology designed by the W3C Incubator group. SSN provides a standardized framework for describing sensors, actuators, observations, features of interest, observed properties, and more. By defining a common semantics and structure, SSN facilitates interoperability and enables seamless data exchange and collaboration among het- erogeneous IoT systems. In addition, they offer researchers and practitioners a powerful tool for enhancing data management, knowledge representation, and decision-making processes. SSN has served as the basis of many different ontologies, among others, the SOSA ontology, one of the most used ontologies for IoT systems. With its formal representation and standardized vocabulary, SOSA provides a comprehensive framework for modeling and interlinking devices\u2019 measure- ment, their associated metadata, and the physical entities involved in the IoT ecosystem [6]. As such, it supports a wide range of applications and use cases, including smart environments. The SOSA ontology encompasses over fifty distinct classes, facilitating a granular representation of various aspects of IoT data [6]. These classes are interconnected through more than a hundred object properties, forming a rich and expressive knowledge graph. The ontology has been designed to be efficient and compact, allowing for easy imple- mentation and minimizing resource overhead on IoT devices. Another advantage of the SOSA ontology is its lightweight nature, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained IoT environments [10]. The widespread adoption of SOSA reflects its effectiveness in enabling seamless integration and interoperability among heterogeneous IoT systems. For all of these reasons, we chose to reference both SNN and SOSA standard specifications for representing IoT entities in our approach. Their modular structure and class-based approach allow us to represent the different components of IoT systems in a detailed and interconnected manner, facilitating integration and interoperability among the components and services involved. However, the SSN and SOSA ontology models, as-it-is, are not \u201coperational\u201d or \u201cready for use\u201d in the context of MDE systems. Additional steps are necessary to operationalize the SOSA ontology by transforming it into 3 a Platform-Independent Model (PIM) that can be effectively interpreted by an MDE system. To achieve this, the concepts from the ontology need to be mapped to appropriate classes, attributes and associations. III. M ETHODOLOGY In this section, we present an overview of the research steps we followed to operationalize SOSA to a PIM. The key steps and involved components are depicted in Figure 3 as an instantiation of the last column in Figure 1. As a starting point, based on the SSN/SOSA ontology, we developed a generic data model representing the structural view of the domain model. Following the MERODE method- ology, the data view is completed with default behavioural and object interaction views. In line with Design Science Research [7], we adopted an iterative approach, switching be- tween build/design and evaluation through prototyping, aiming to continuously enhance the quality of the domain model. The evaluation step aimed at verifying 1) that the domain model was designed to be static and standardized, enabling its reusability in the development of various IoT systems and 2) that it can serve as executable model for the automated generation software using a code generator. The final evaluation of the resulting domain model is done through the implementation of a real life case using the gen- erated software. In the following sections, we present a brief introduction to MERODE (section IV), the model that was designed (section V) and the evaluation on the Leuven.cool case (section VI). IV. T HE MERODE A PPROACH In this section we present an overview of the MERODE approach, highlighting its main features, the domain model used to generate the Enterprise Layer (EL), System Service Layer (ISL), and related tools. A. MERODE in a Nutshell Over the years, various approaches have been developed to design and develop information systems, aiming to improve their effectiveness and alignment with organizational needs. One notable approach in this field is the MERODE approach [15]. The MERODE approach builds on UML, but uses only a subset of its constructs, complemented with proprietary notions, to enable the generation of fully functional code from conceptual models. In particular, the class diagram is refined to an \u201cexistence dependency\u201d graph, and object interaction is formalized by means of the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) process algebra [14]. B. The MERODE Domain Model (EDG, OET, and FSMs) A typical MERODE analysis or conceptualization consists of three views: a so-called Existence Dependency Graph (EDG) similar to a UML class diagram, a proprietary concept called Object Event Table (OET) defining object-event inter- actions, and a set of Finite State Machines (FSMs). We can refer to the set of these three models as the Domain Model. Figure 4 depicts the three models describing the domain of people renting a car. The Existence Dependency Graph (EDG) is designed to define business object types (classes) and their associations. The EDG is represented by a UML class diagram, where all associations express existence dependency. Each class in the diagram is also associated with a State Chart (SC) or Finite State Machine (FSM). Business event types, considered phenomena shared be- tween the real world and the information system [9], are operationalized as call events. These events can trigger state changes in multiple business objects. The Object-Event table (OET) maps business event types to business object types, indicating the type of state change caused by each business event type: creation (C), modification (M), or ending (E). The OET helps identify the necessary operations for handling events in corresponding classes. In particular, the propaga- tion rule specifies that a master object can always \u201csee\u201d the business events to which its dependents react, thereby participating in those events as well. Consequently, a single business event can trigger state changes in multiple business objects, allowing them to synchronize and interact through their joint participation in these events. Finite State Machines (FSMs) define the behavior of objects by illustrating how events cause state transitions. Each object type follows a default lifecycle, involving creation triggered by any creation event (*/C), multiple modifications triggered by modification events (*/M), and transitions triggered by ending events (*/E) that lead to the final state. More specific FSMs can be defined to add desired behaviors to the system. Domain models can be created using the MERLIN tool 1, which also provides features for checking the consistency and readiness of the models for transformation. C. The MERLIN Code Generator for MERODE MERLIN Code Generator 2 is a standalone Java application that can be used to generate code from a MERODE domain model exported from MERLIN as .mxp file. Two different types of code can be generated: a Java prototype of the application, or a RESTful web application. Both solutions are based on the logic defined in the domain model. The Java prototype encompasses a Domain Layer comprising the database and business logic, and a series of default services that are accessible through a default Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI has one tab per object type defined in the domain model, displaying a list and details of the objects that exist in the system, and it offers buttons for triggering the business events, thus allowing to create, modify and end object instances. Furthermore, the prototypes are enhanced with feedback, both textual and graphical. In particular, the models are embedded in the application, thus enabling the tracing of the prototype\u2019s behavior back to the models and validating their semantic quality. The RESTful web application consists of a Maven project, containing the same Domain Layer and offering a range of 1https://www.merlin-academic.com/ 2https://merode.econ.kuleuven.be/CodeGeneration.html 4 Models Digital Twin Design Obs./Act.

API services for each business event and for querying data from the system. Instead of triggering the business event types through buttons in the GUI, they can be invoked through POST API services.To retrieve information about the system\u2019s entities, GET requests can be made by directly referring to each instance of the objects. Figure 5 provides a visual representation helping to clarify the mapping of business events into API services. The logic behind the creation of these APIs is orchestrated by the constraints, rules, and existing dependencies defined in the domain model. For example, if an object \u03b2 has a dependency on the creation of another object \u03b1, the API to create the object \u03b2 cannot be executed unless the object \u03b1 has been created first. This ensures that the required dependencies are satisfied before proceeding with the creation of the object \u03b2. The approach proposed in this paper considers the RESTful Service Layer: Web APIs Domain Layer: Data MERODE models EndCreateCreateCreate EndEndModifyModifyModify ReadReadReadRead Domain Layer: Business Logic GET POST Fig. 5: The Three Layers of MERODE. web application APIs for generating safe IoT system entities and controlled functionalities. V. S UPPORTING DIGITAL TWINS SYSTEMS INTEGRATING THE MERODE A PPROACH This section delves into the mapping process through which we derived the domain model from the SSN/SOSA ontology. Then, we discuss constraints and changes applied to the domain model derived. A. Mapping of SSN/SOSA Ontology to Domain Model To create a PIM for IoT that can be effectively interpreted by a MDE system, we started with an in-depth examination of the SOSA ontology\u2019s standard specifications. To translate the necessary classes and association into a MERODE-model, we adopted an iterative approach. In each iteration, after com- pleting a version of the model, we conducted tests to assess its effectiveness to represent various cases of IoT systems and to identify improvements. The first iteration started with the straightforward translation of the standard. The tests revealed 5 several deficiencies mostly related to the associations between the classes, and revealed ambiguities in the interpretation of SOSA concepts. We therefore made necessary modifications to the model in subsequent iterations, gradually enhancing its quality both in terms of model structure as definition of the classes. The final diagram is depicted in Figure 6. Table I lists all the nine classes involved in our standard IoT EDG. In defining the model, we aimed to adhere closely to the standard, while at the same time generalizing certain aspects. In particular, we chose to consolidate and generalize certain classes from the standard into a single class. Out of these, five classes align precisely with the SSN/SOSA standard, namely: Platform, Feature Of Interest, Procedure, Property and Result. The classes Device and Device Usage serve as generalizations of one or more classes in the stan- dard. Specifically, Device encompasses the sosa:Sensor and sosa:Actuator classes, while Device Usage encompasses the sosa:Observation, sosa:Actuation, and sosa:Sampling classes. Additionally, two classes introduced by us are Registered Device and Platform Deployment. The former is used for referring to a specific instance of a device in the platform, while the latter refers to a specific instance usage of the platform for a feature of interest. Starting from the top, we have the class Platform which represents an entity on which IoT devices are hosted. The Feature of Interest class represents a real-world thing on which measurements take place. The Device class represents a component capable of sensing or actuating in an IoT system. The Procedure class represents a specific process or method followed by a device to generate a result of a measurement. It encapsulates the steps, actions, or algorithms involved in carrying out a particular task or operation. The Property class specifies a measurable characteristic associated with a feature of interest. The Result class represents the value of the output obtained from a measurement performed by a device. Device Usage class specifies the type of usage of a device to perform observations or actuations and when they are made. B. Adding Multiple Path Constraints and Customized State In some cases, objects are existence dependent on a master object. This means that an instance of such an object can be created if and only if an instance of the master class exists [15]. Sometimes an object type is indirectly dependent on the same master object type in two different ways (i.e. via multiple paths). For example, in Figure 6, both Property and Platform Deployment are existence dependent on the Feature of Interest class. Consequently, the Device Usage class is existence dependent on both Platform Deployment and Property and indirectly existence dependent on Feature of Interest. From a logical point of view, the purpose of the Device Usage class is to provide the means to specify the type of operation to be performed on a device, such as observation or actuation. However, for the safe execution of these operations, the Device Usageclass relies on operational information obtained from the master classes it is connected to. In our model, we have established business rules to enforce these requirements and ensure the secure execution of device operations. These rules dictate that an instance of the Device Usage class must adhere to three indirectly multiple path constraints depicted in Figure 7. As an example, we consider the second rule. It states that the Feature of Interest, (i.e., a private garden), must be consistent across both the derived Property (i.e., relative humidity of that specific garden) and the corresponding Platform Deploy- ment. In this context, consistency means that the instance of the Property class and the associated Platform Deployment must both reference the same instance of the Feature of Interest class. This constraint is explicitly expressed within the Device Usage object: self.Property.FeatureOfInterest == self.PlatformDeployment.FeatureOfInterest. By imposing this constraint, we ensure that each Device Usage object relates to only one Feature of Interest and that each event type of the Device Usage involves a single object of the Feature of Interest. Additionally, we have refined the lifecycle of the Registered Device and Device Usage entities. The \u201cDevice Usage\u201d class enables the deployment of a device. By creating an instance of the \u201cDevice Usage\u201d object, the planned state is achieved. Next, a modifying method \u201csetReady\u201d is executed and the ready state is reached, indicating that the device is ready for use. Finally, by executing the \u201cDeviceDeployment\u201d event, the device starts to perform the measurement. In the case of the \u201cRegistered Device\u201d FSM, after creating an instance of the object, the \u201cDeviceDeployment\u201d method can be executed to achieve the deployed state. If you want to deploy the same device for other measurements, it is required to return to the initial state by executing the \u201cDeviceUndeployment\u201d method first, thereby ending the previous device usage. VI. E VALUATION In this chapter, we first present a brief explanation of the use case on which the proposed approach was evaluated. Then, we check the usability of the approach focusing on its implementation and simulation. Finally, we acknowledge a set of limitations regarding the proposed approach. A. Use Case: Leuven.cool The Leuven.cool project, conducted by KU Leuven in collaboration with the climate NGO Leuven2030, Leuven City, and the Royal Meteorological Institute (KMI), aims to examine the urban microclimate of Leuven [3]. The project is centered around understanding how natural elements can help reduce negative impacts. To achieve this, weather stations have been installed in both private gardens and public locations throughout Leuven to measure the microclimate. Figure 8 depicts the network of the weather stations in Leuven and its stations. The research project provides valuable insights into the opti- mal spatial configuration of green and blue elements, enabling managers and decision-makers to effectively plan and manage urban green (plants) and blue (water) areas to maximize their cooling effects. Each area is equipped with a weather station 6 Fig. 6: The MERODE Domain Model derived from the SSN/SOSA Ontology. 7 Derived EDG SSN/SOSA Ontology Description Platform sosa:Platform A Platform is an entity that hosts other entities, particularly Sensors, Actuators, and other Platforms. Feature Of Interest sosa:FeatureOfInterest The thing whose property is being estimated or calculated in the course of an Observation to arrive at a Result.

To access real- time urban climate data, it is possible to visit the Leuven.cool website3, which provides access to the map of weather stations and where each dot represents a DT of a garden or public area. B. Feasibility of the Approach To assess the feasibility of our approach, we tested the usability of the derived domain model by populating it with instances representing a weather station of the Leuven.cool project. To discuss how the data management works, we consider the five components of a DT architecture, discussed in Section II-B. The domain model derived from the SSN/SOSA ontology, the java application prototype, and the web applica- tion are available here 4. Physical Entity (PE).The physical entities in this scenario encompass the weather station itself, along with its set of sensors, and the surrounding environment. Specifically, within the Leuven.cool project, a weather station consists of various sensors designed to monitor a range of weather phenomena. These include a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, two wind sensors for measuring wind speed and direction, a radiation sensor, and a UV sensor. Virtual Entity (VE). Virtual entities are represented and described by the domain model derived from the ontology. 3https://leuven.cool/ 4https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ModDIT-23 A minimal representation of the instances in each class of the model is depicted in Figure 9. To begin, we established instances of the top-level classes: Platform, Feature of Interest, and Device. We defined a general platform instance on which devices would be hosted, designated the garden as a Feature of Interest for which measurements would be collected, and created a collection of sensors as instances of the Device class. Next, we proceeded to create instances for the second- level classes: Procedure, Property, Platform Deployment, and Registered Device. We generated five instances of the Property class to represent measurable attributes of real-world objects (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind di- rection, solar radiation, UV index), and an additional five instances for Procedure to describe the operational methods of the devices. Instances of Platform Deploymentand Registered Device were created by referring to the master object instances. Subsequently, by creating an instance of the Device Usage class, it became possible to set up the deployment of a device by referencing the instances of the second-level classes. Finally, for each device, we defined the Result class containing attributes related to the values measured by the device. Service. The services provided in this approach consist of a set of APIs generated in the web application. The entities involved in the IoT system can perform a set of actions by directly executing an API to trigger a business event or inspect data. The execution of these APIs is orchestrated following the rules and constraints defined during the design of the domain model. Data. Data management in the context of MERODE is based on interconnected object types, which are effectively ad- dressed by the EDG domain model. To cater to the persistence of data, the EDG model is transformed into a database schema. In this process, each object type will by default be mapped to a corresponding database relation. To cater to proper implemen- tation, associations will by default be converted to foreign keys referring to the ID of the corresponding master object type. API services rely on the database schema to ensure compliance between services and data. Connection. The bi-directional communication between the Physical and Digital entities is provided using of API ser- vices. The API-oriented communication mechanism allows for reliability and robustness in communications since business 8 Fig. 8: The Leuven.cool Network and its Weather Stations.

Thus, through the web application and APIs, users can interact with both physical and digital entities. For instance, it is possible to initiate pull operations, such as measuring the temperature of a garden, and then the web application retrieves data from the physical environment and presents it to the user in a digital format. On the other hand, also push operations are allowed, since users can trigger ac- tions that have an impact on the physical world. For example, users can utilize the web application\u2019s API to send a command for turning off a device in the garden. C. Limitations Currently, this study has some limitations concerning the domain model derived from the SSN/SOSA ontology and regarding some technical aspects. Firstly, the attributes in the EDG domain model still need to be defined. The EDG model was derived by mapping classes from the SSN/SOSA ontology, without considering yet the inclusion of attributes. In the current implementation, only a single generic attribute \u201cname/id\u201d has been provided in each class, to allow for simulating and evaluating the proposed ap- proach. In addition, the bidirectional communication between the physical and digital entities can only occur through the manual execution of API services, which poses a constraint in the automation of communication processes. Lastly, the proposed approach allows for an \u201cout of the box\u201d representation of a DT system, without considering the actual technical implementation of the system. A full-fledged implementation of a DT will require more complex details than those described in this study. VII. C ONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK In this work, we have introduced an approach that leverages the MERODE modeling method along with a generic domain model derived from the SSN/SOSA ontology to take a signif- icant step forward in engineering DT systems. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging a domain model 9 from standard ontologies in specifying the digitalization of IoT technologies. By employing the domain model, we can accurately represent and describe the digital aspects of IoT technologies, facilitating their seamless integration into DT systems. This solution enables the verification and monitoring of expected behavior with minimal computational costs and development efforts. The strength of our approach lies in the modeling method provided by MERODE, which allows for rapid prototyping and validation using real-life cases. In addi- tion, ontologies facilitated the definition of semantic data mod- els combined with domain knowledge and the formulation of inference strategies, further enhancing the effectiveness of our approach. This promoted data integration and interoperability, allowing for seamless management of heterogeneous data into DT systems. To evaluate the feasibility of our approach, we applied it to a real-world use case from the Leuven.cool project. Through the use of web APIs, we achieved manual bi-directional communication between physical and digital entities, effectively replicating real-world actions in the digital realm. However, implementing full-fledged DTs can be a non- trivial task. While our approach does offer robust software engineering methods and practices to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of data exchange, there is still ongoing work required to address technical implementation aspects within the scope of our study. We have identified several areas of focus that we intend to address in the near future. One of our goals is to enhance the usability of the RESTful web application by implementing a web interface. Then, we plan to replace the current manual communication with bidirectional automated communication between physical and digital entities. The study conducted by [16], provides evidence of the effectiveness of integrating MERODE with BPMN and DMN, resulting in a modeling approach that is process, data, and decision-aware. The study also demonstrates the successful operationalization of this approach, resulting in an executable process and decision system. This integration enables the realization of an integrated view of data and pro- cesses, ensuring enhanced coherence and alignment between operational activities and domain concepts. Building upon these findings, our objective is to automate the communication between physical and digital entities. Finally, we plan to focus on implementing the attributes in the EDG domain model, using an iterative approach that involves testing and applying improvements to the model. By employing this iterative methodology, we aim to achieve a more comprehensive and refined representation of the ontol- ogy, enhancing its accuracy in describing and representing the real-world aspects within the context of a DT.

There exists a large body of research on classifying errors in business pro- cess modeling (BPM) and on the importance of higher-quality process models in the early design stages. Some works have defined quality frameworks and listed guidelines for modeling to help modelers achieve higher-quality diagrams. But there is no established way in which BPM should be taught, and there is a research gap in connecting instructional design and BPM. The current study addresses this gap by presenting a teaching module on BPM at a higher education institute in blended learning contexts. To improve the skill sets of novice modelers it is crucial to teach them how to interpret and integrate quality into BPM by giving them feedback on errors they make. We achieve this by leveraging pedagogy, incorporating formative assessments and an error typology. Index Terms\u2014Teaching BPM, Feedback on errors, Formative assessment, Formative feedback, Learning report I. I NTRODUCTION Process Modeling (PM) plays a crucial role in contemporary businesses, particularly in software development life cycles and in the (re)-design and (re)-engineering of processes. Since the use of low-quality models in the initial stages of design can have harmful effects [30] and prove to be highly costly during subsequent design phases [37], process models must adhere to a set of rules defined by the modeling grammar. This adherence ensures the syntactic correctness of the models, emphasizing the importance of maintaining their syntactic quality. Furthermore, process models should be complete in terms of requirements, incorporating only accurate and rele- vant statements that pertain to the domain [33], thus providing semantic correctness. Novice business analysts will be placed at an advantage in organizations if they have developed strong modeling skill sets during their university education. PMPMIn the domain of PM, while there are several studies on PM comprehension [9], [17], [22], [28], and guidelines on modeling offered for novice modelers [2], [3], [12], [27], studies on how to teach PM are quite rare. A recent literature review on conceptual modeling in education [31], focuses on studies to explore the complexities of learning conceptual modeling for novice modelers. This review reported on sev- eral methods and pedagogical resources, encompassing 121 published papers from 1986 to 2017. The review revealed a limited emphasis on PM, accounting for only 8% of the included studies. While feedback emerged as one of the extensively researched themes, there is a scarcity of studies demonstrating the practical implementation of feedback to teach PM in blended learning (BL) course contexts and there has been relatively less attention in terms of research devoted to teaching methodologies. To the best of our knowledge, there have not been any studies on identifying specific learning objectives (LOs) in teaching PM, emerging patterns of errors by novice modelers, and linking them to higher levels of Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy [24] within a BL course context. Recognizing this research gap, there is a growing need to focus on developing effective instructional strategies, frame- works, and guidelines specifically tailored to teaching PM. Such research efforts can contribute to the advancement of pedagogical knowledge in PM education and provide edu- cators with the necessary tools and techniques to effectively teach crucial aspects of Business Process Management (BPM). The teaching of PM holds a prominent position on research agendas in the field of PM discipline [18], [31]. Proficiency in PM is crucial for effectively managing or automating business processes. However, learning PM presents challenges due to its inherent complexity, which requires specific cognitive frame- works and practical experience [34]. Improving the training of process modelers can contribute to the acquisition of the necessary skills for PM, potentially addressing the prevalent issue of subpar process model quality within organizations [9]. In this paper, we present a flexible PM module as a facile example for educators, with the aim of unraveling the complexities involved in teaching PM to novice modelers. When designing the PM module, several crucial decision points were taken into consideration to ensure alignment with pedagogical principles, existing research, and available PM educational resources. Further, specifically for the learning materials at the highest Bloom level (Create) that involve practicing modeling, feedback on errors was offered. The present work dwells on the mode of feedback, the quality of feedback, and how possible improvement in both learning instruction and feedback can be identified from the current exploratory error analysis. II. B ACKGROUND A. Quality of Process Models and Guidelines on Modeling Several frameworks and guidelines have been proposed for process model quality (PMQ) to reduce errors and pro- vide metrics for assessing process model quality. Notable frameworks include Guidelines of Modeling (GoM) [3], seven PM guidelines (7PMG) [27], and Quality of Process Models (3QM) [29]. The comprehensive PMQ framework proposed in [13] discusses various existing frameworks and emphasizes the significance of syntactic quality as the only metric that can be directly observed and objectively measured. GoM presents six generic guidelines for PM, but lacks specific metrics for measurement, making it less practical for non-experts. 7PMG addresses this limitation with user-friendly indicators for novice modelers, although it may have a narrower scope. 3QM builds upon earlier frameworks and offers comprehen- sive metrics and measurement procedures for assessing process model quality. Additionally, other guidelines and metrics have been developed to focus on specific aspects of PMQ, such as model complexity [36], understandability [12], and process model comprehension [15]. In order to teach novice modelers and assess their understanding of modeling, it is essential to train them on the best practices of modeling. With more than eight years of teaching the BPM module in multiple courses, the teaching team incorporated guidelines from several of these references mentioned here. B. Errors and Feedback for Modeling Education Business Process Modeling is often prone to both syntactic and semantic errors. Bolloju and Narasimha [8] propose that novice modelers can improve the quality of their conceptual models by being aware of common types of errors and receiv- ing feedback during the learning process. Novice modelers tend to make similar errors in learning modeling and error persistence even at higher levels of proficiency [5]. These can be avoided with appropriate feedback right from the start. The Hattie and Timperley feedback model [21] suggests that feedback should address fundamental questions (i.e., \u201dwhat\u201d and \u201dhow\u201d) to guide students in achieving the LOs and understanding the steps necessary to reach them. To this end, Bogdanova [6] takes a step further by categorizing errors by novice modelers in domain modeling into an ontology; and aligns the LOs and errors with Bloom\u2019s taxonomy in aiming to enhance pedagogical effectiveness. In a series of papers [5]\u2013 [7], Bogdanova impresses on the course of action to be taken Fig. 1. Course timeline in weeks in achieving this through a semi-automated tool that generates personalized feedback reports for student-submitted models. However, providing personalized feedback for every mod- eling exercise can be challenging for instructors in HE, particularly when dealing with large student cohorts.To ad- dress this challenge, alternative approaches such as group feedback sessions, online feedback, or just-in-time teaching have been proven successful in various educational settings. These approaches provide valuable alternatives to personal- ized feedback and can effectively support learning processes. Moreover, within the PM domain, while modern modeling environments offer verification support that can automatically identify certain errors [35], there is still a lack of sufficient support, especially for errors related to semantics. Recognizing this gap, Haisjackl et al. [20] conducted an exploratory study on how humans inspect process models. The study highlighted the importance of adopting a systematic approach to model inspection, through the implementation of test-driven devel- opment and the use of automated checklists. This systematic approach can help address the need for comprehensive support in identifying and rectifying modeling errors. A framework called Model Judge was proposed in 2019, using the full power of Natural Language Processing and optimization techniques to validate models and provide di- agnostics to learners regarding the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic quality of drawn models [32]. On the Model Judge platform, learners can draw their models on the interface (powered by Camunda) and check their diagrams against the textual description at several stages of the designing process with the potential to improve process quality. The authors as instructors find that this could be an exceedingly useful tool for instructing students but it does not include specific LOs and pattern finding that is vital from the teaching perspective of this particular course. As existing tools or frameworks did not satisfactorily fit into the current study, an error ontology was created with Individual Errors and Patterns based on the most commonly accepted modeling framework proposed by [25] for its ease of use.

Audience & Course Setting The BPMN module was designed as a part of an optional course on \u201cBPM and Software Systems Design\u201d(BPM&SSD) followed by students enrolled in the second semester of a one- year Master in Business Administration (MBA). The MBA program is offered both in English and Dutch at the Business 2 TABLE I COURSE ORGANIZATION OLA Main learning ECTs SA BPM part Activities in SA Part 1 Lessons, quizzes, 3 Written Exam 5 points practical exercises 10 points Individual Exam Part 2 Solving a real 3 Case Report 5 points case in a group 10 points Group assignment Faculty of a Belgian university. The students enrolled in this academic Master\u2019s have commenced this program after completing either an academic Bachelor, a bridging program after a professional Bachelor, or another Master\u2019s degree (See [1]). The students following this course are considered novice modelers with very little or no prior modeling experience. B. Course Organization Table I outlines the course organization into two separate educational activities or parts - (1) Part 1 - learning the techniques of designing PM and the details needed for the design of software systems through theoretical and practical sessions and (2) Part 2 - developing the Case (Case). Each part holds 3 ECTs, each with a separate specific Summative Assessment (SA). In the first part, techniques for BPM are taught along with the depiction of common software systems like ERP, SRM, etc., found in organizations. The necessary tools required to design software systems e.g., presenting use cases, making cost estimations of the project, structuring databases, etc. are taught. The SA for this part is a written test consisting of multiple-choice, open, and closed questions adding up to 50% of the total score (10 out of 20 points). The second part consists of an assignment (Case) in which the students work in groups on a company project. They face an unstructured context of information needs and translate this into a structured report depicting processes (using BPMN), and other elements, proposing a database design and cost estimation. The result is presented to the client (a company or organization) and defended orally during the exam period. A Case report is the SA for the remaining 10 points. In both the SAs, there is high weightage with 5 out of 10 points in each part for modeling processes. In the rest of the paper, we focus solely on the PM content of this course - the BPM learning module containing the learning items (lessons and formative tests), the modeling questions on the written SA (5 points), and the modeling part of the SA Case report (5 points). C. Learning Objectives & Blooms Taxonomy In designing the BPM learning module, we enforced the scaffolding levels of Blooms Taxonomy as described by [4] for domain modeling, applying the revised Bloom levels of educational objectives [24] to PM. Primarily, the SAs of the course identified at the highest cognitive level of \u201dCreate\u201d was taken into account when the learning content was designed. For the BPM part, both in the SA Written exam and the Case report, the students are asked to model a given textual de- scription of processes using BPMN needing an expert level of familiarity with PM. The LOs and the content were classified into different Bloom levels. The formative assessments (FAs) consisted of FA quizzes at lower Bloom levels (Understand, Analyse, Evaluate) as compared to PM FA exercises at the highest Bloom level (Create) similar to that of the SAs. To establish the relevance of considering Bloom\u2019s levels for FAs, a preliminary correlation analysis was performed (not showcased here) between the SAs vs. FA quizzes and FA ex- ercises. For an SA at a high Bloom\u2019s level, the corresponding FAs at higher Bloom levels are more correlated. This result showed the usefulness of utilizing FAs at the same Bloom level as the SAs and looking more closely at the LOs of the FA exercises. To this end, the instructors were particular that the main LOs of the course are for the students to detect and design different Individual Elements and Patterns from textual descriptions. Each FA exercise was chosen such that sequentially, the students encounter from the lowest difficulty level, with the first exercise having only one decision point and with most of the later exercises having several Advanced elements and Patterns to be modeled. D. Modeling Tool Use Visual Paradigm was used as the modeling tool for its flexibility in drawing process diagrams and in other function- alities necessary for making the Case Study. It does not offer extensive feedback on syntactic errors, unlike other tools like Signavio or Camunda. While these tools may provide feedback on syntactic correctness, and identify incompleteness utilizing meta-models and static semantics, one of the authors who uses Signavio in another course on modeling, observed that students often ignore the suggestions made by the tool. E. Proposed Format The course is designed to follow the flipped classroom prin- ciple with the theoretical sessions furnished as pre-recorded online material for the students to follow at their will and their own pace. The in-person sessions are devoted to practical exercises, interaction with the teacher, feedback, and seminars from industry experts. In lieu of the university\u2019s response to post-pandemic circumstances and culture, where a reduced number of students attended in-person classes but took the exam; most of the learning material was also required to be available online asynchronously. The complete course timeline is depicted in Figure 1. F . Learning Content & Mode of Delivery Following the literature studies and books on the BPMN notation [10], [11], [16], the BPMN learning material has been organized into two main sections: BPMN Basics and Advanced. These sections were thoughtfully structured and included specific fixed content items, such as lessons and practice exercise sessions. The course design and delivery modes facilitate the proposed format in the following way: Lessons were planned as videos with each video having a cen- tral focus on specific BPMN concepts. Interspersed between 3 the 4 BPMN Basics and 7 BPMN advanced videos, 6 FA quizzes, and 8 FA exercises were planned to help the student with self-evaluation and self-regulation. The FA exercises were set up with increasing levels of complexity and knowledge to be sequentially solved in a specific order following the introduction of new elements in BPMN in the lessons. These learning items were also offered online giving autonomy to the learners to pace themselves and to work on it at home in case they cannot come to class. G. Formative Assessments, Feedback, and Adaptive Release Beyond evaluation and measuring the effectiveness of learn- ing, assessments can motivate, activate, and help students self- regulate and achieve their learning goals [26]. Two types of FAs are used in the BPM module - 6 Quizzes and 8 Exercises. We focus primarily on the FA exercises in this study. Incorporating feedback into the teaching and learn- ing processes and its influence on the learning outcomes in different learning (traditional, blended, or online) contexts have been well-established in the extant literature [14], [19], [23]. For training the students in modeling, high value was attributed to giving feedback on their solutions through in- person sessions for solving the exercises. During exercise sessions, at first, a few exercises were solved step-by-step to introduce how a textual description can be interpreted and a process diagram be realized. Students are given time to solve more exercises by themselves, and the instructor and teach- ing assistant help with individual difficulties and give group feedback. Possible solutions, good modeling practices, strong emphasis on common difficulties and errors are discussed for each exercise at the end. This is done to facilitate discussion and aid students improve the quality of their models. From previous research, [4] reflecting on resources and exercises for teaching modeling, and verbal feedback received from students over the years, great attention was paid to the list of exercises offered in the course through the in-person exercises sessions and the FA exercises. They were chosen/created such that the difficulty level of the exercises was increasing, and covered all main elements and concepts covered in the lectures. In total 23 exercises were seen in the course with 8 of them as FA exercises on the LMS. The feedback element on solving exercises is also added to the learning content available online asynchronously for the FA exercises. Feedback on the common mistakes and (specifically semantic) errors in the solutions has been offered in feedback videos which become available via adaptive re- lease when an FA exercise is submitted on the LMS. The adaptive release of learning material was chosen to motivate and activate students to solve the FA exercises before con- sulting the solutions directly. Each FA exercise was mapped to specific LOs. See Table II for examples of LOs mapped to a few exercises. Each of the exercises labeled 1 to 8 was presented sequentially in the course presentation. So the students would have to attempt them chronologically. Over time, newer concepts were introduced and the level of TABLE II LINKING LEARNING OBJECTIVES AND FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS Learning Objectives for Ex 02 Ex 04 Ex 06 Ex 08 Detecting and designing Individual Elements: Activities, sequence flows, x x x x start/end events, Pools and lanes, messages, x x x x message flows Gateways - XOR, AND x Gateways - Inclusive OR x Gateways - Event-based x x Patterns: Deadlines x x x Request-response synchronous x x x Process scope x x difficulty of the exercises increased requiring to employ new knowledge of elements taught in the lessons. IV. M ETHODOLOGY & ERROR TYPOLOGY A. Data Collection The participants in this study are all the students enrolled in the course BPM&SSD. The student submissions to the 8 FA exercises were collected from the LMS grade center for error analysis. Additional information on the submission of exercises and the feedback videos watched were collected from the log data for the LMS. According to the log data, there were 160 attempts for the 8 FA exercises. However, the extraction from the grade center only presented 92 BPMN diagrams which were either submitted as jpeg, png, pdf, or vpp files. This drop in numbers could be perhaps because the students used the wrong file formats for submission or did not complete the submission correctly. Among the submitted files, wrong uploads (e.g. same file submitted for all exercises, other files uploaded, etc.) were filtered, leading to a final number of 80 diagrams to evaluate. B. Correcting Process Modeling Exercises Three evaluators assessed the quality of these submitted models. Two were members of the teaching team (one pro- fessor and a teaching assistant) and one BPM researcher. The first few diagrams were corrected together with discussions on the errors, solutions, and definitions so as to maintain relia- bility across evaluators. Each evaluator checked the corrected models and errors marked by the other evaluators to validate consistency. The evaluators manually corrected these diagrams with an emphasis on whether LOs were being met or not. The names and definitions of the errors were discussed. Each error was named using the combination of the Specification (Missing/Wrong/Obsolete) and the Error Source (a particular Individual Element/Pattern) related to the LOs. Each error was captured including each occurrence of the error in each model (per student, per exercise) adding up to a final error list. C. Typology of Errors As reported in section II-A, error classification into groups has been investigated and reported on PM comprehension and quality research. However, how the feedback on these errors 4 should be given to novice modelers is rarely clarified. Quite typically the errors made by the novice modelers do not strictly follow these classifications. In the current study, a structured bottom-up approach was used in constructing the complete list of errors and categorizing them. Next, in order to extract actionable feedback for students, the errors were classified into the below-mentioned dimensions beyond just the widely used syntactic and semantic categorization. 1) Semantic vs Syntactic: The first categorization was based on existing literature as mentioned in section II-A. While Syn- tactic errors refer to the formal syntax of the model: mainly, the modeling notation; Semantic errors are those related to the validity and completeness of the model. Each error is bagged into Semantic or Syntactic categories. Pragmatic errors are those that hinder comprehension or affect the executability of the model, with the focus of this study more on learning and less on execution, we don\u2019t consider pragmatic quality included in the scope of this study. 2) Individual Elements vs. Patterns: The principal LOs for this teaching module are to understand the textual description of the process and to detect and design models from it. From the text, the learners are expected to detect not only Individual Elements but also specific Patterns to be modeled. Designing a pattern involves many Individual Elements coming together to make a specific combination. A pattern can be present in several contexts (in several exercises) and on recognition, it can be modeled using one or more predefined solutions (usually containing a group of elements). Some of the Patterns taught as part of the LOs of the exercise sessions and the FA exercises relate to the modeling of (1) deadlines (involving event-based gateways, racing events, or a receiving message task with boundary events), (2) treatment of a batch of instances (requiring loops, dealing with individual instances, subprocesses with tasks, decision points), and (3) request response Patterns (collaboration between pools), etc. Making a mistake in understanding and recognizing particu- lar elements from the text will result in an Individual Element error. Errors in recognizing and modeling Patterns could result from (1) mistakes in one or more corresponding Individual Elements, (2) mistakes in connecting the corresponding Indi- vidual Elements, or (3) correctly using Individual Elements syntactically but not capturing the pattern itself. Lastly, there can also be errors like \u2018implicit ending\u2019, \u2018deadlock\u2019, etc which did not originate from the LOs of the module but arise due to process properties. We classify these as Patterns, as they cannot be detected without looking at the process as a whole. 3) Basic vs Advanced: As mentioned in the section III-F, the modeling notation (BPMN) was introduced/taught as Basic and Advanced sub-chapters containing several basic and ad- vanced Elements and Patterns. Using the Error Source, each error was placed into these binate Basic and Advanced labels. 4) Priority Levels: When grading the modeling questions in the SA, there have to be specific metrics necessary to award or reduce points assigned for the exercise. Even though the FA exercises are not scored but are meant for practice and delivery of feedback, the teaching team reflected on which of the errors TABLE III EXAMPLES FROM THE ERROR TYPOLOGY WITH APPLIED CATEGORIES . Syntactic Individual Priority Basic Specifi- Error Source /Semantic Element /Adv cation /Pattern Syntactic Individual high Basic Missing Gateway Syntactic Individual mid Basic Missing End event Semantic Individual low Basic Missing Task symbol Semantic Individual high Adv Obsolete Event Based gateway Semantic Pattern high Adv Missing Batch (Loop) Semantic Pattern high Adv Wrong Batch (Loop) were of more priority than others. Scoring on the SA was scrutinized and the priority of the mistakes/error was applied to the submitted FA exercises. Errors were categorized also into low, mid, and high-priority levels based on the LOs for each exercise. Basic notions such as style errors are low priority, comprehension of text issues is mid-priority, and inability to model Patterns are high-priority. 5) Design vs Labeling - Individual Elements: For each Individual Element that is expected to be modeled, the two- fold objectives are to care for the design of the element itself and correctly label it. Labeling errors were captured within the error names, in the Specification part (e.g. Missing label - Task, Wrong label - Event). At first, labeling errors were marked and recorded along with Design errors. They occurred in most of the exercises but they were exceedingly many for specific exercises (e.g. when Exercise has a LO of communication between pools). It was noticed that students not only missed the labeling of messages but start/end events consistently through exercises, and used the wrong name conventions and missed mentioned task types. The teaching team reflected that the FA instructions did not explicitly mention labeling even though it was mentioned as a good practice in the lessons multiple times. In addition, when scoring a diagram in the summative assessment, these labeling errors have the lowest weight. Lastly, as none of the students used labeling on the summative written exam and case report, this syntactic group of errors was dropped from the complete list. D. Analyzing Errors As each solution to an exercise depends on the degree of abstraction or granularity, some errors may be specific to one exercise. The following steps were followed to capture common errors across exercises. For every diagram submitted by the student, each distinct error and the frequency of occurrences in the diagram are captured. Also per exercise, the number of students committing one distinct error is captured. Next, a complete list of errors in all exercises was put together. To summarise results, the total frequencies per exercise and the total number of students committing a distinct error are listed together for comparison. Lastly, occurrences of an error across exercises are also captured. The number of errors in different categories is reported and compared in the results and discussion sections. 5 V. R ESULTS AND DISCUSSION The key result from this study is the formalization of errors typology IV-C done to allow for meaningful analysis of the student learning and for designing the BMPN module. We show a few examples with the typology in Table III. Each row contains one error, named with the combination of the Specification level and the Error Source and how it is categorized under different dimensions. 44 types of unique errors were identified, with a total of 207 errors. From all these errors, about 60% (125) are on basic elements of BPMN, while the remaining 40% (82) are on advanced elements. The 42% (87) of the errors are syntactic in nature, while the remaining 58% (120) involve aspects related to semantics. As the error typology included more of the semantic category than syntactic, it was expected that overall frequencies of semantic errors would be higher than syntactic. Figure 2 shows the frequency of syntactic and semantic errors. Counter-intuitively, syntactic errors had a higher frequency than expected as students made the same syntactic error multiple times in a diagram increasing the frequency. Each FA exercise had specific learning outcomes for distinct Individual Elements and Patterns as shown in Table II with the exercises increasing in complexity (and Patterns) from Ex1 to Ex8. This is perfectly reflected in Figure 3 where the percentage of errors in Patterns increases as compared to those of Individual Elements.

Priority-based error percentages in FA exercises of BPMN across all exercises. In the later exercises, there are more Advanced category errors. As the complexity of exercises increases, more Advanced elements and Patterns are required to be modeled in the later exercises, and hence we see a decrease in the percentage of Basic errors. This decrease could possibly also be an effect of feedback offered through videos and in-person and during exercise sessions. Figure 5 shows the error percentages for the priority dimension with no specific trends on low, mid or high priority categories. Figure 6 shows the distinct errors made per student per exercise and the four curves indicate the major Specification categories: Missing, Wrong; paired with the LOs of modeling a Pattern or an Individual Element. The context of each exercise differs in the particular number of Individual Elements and Patterns to be detected and captured in BPMN diagrams affecting the type and number of errors per exercise. We see that there are no Pattern errors (both for Missing or Wrong specifications) in Exercises 1-3, as these were simpler exercises and there were no Patterns to be modeled. Particularly, notice that for Exercise 4 there are more Wrong Element errors committed by students, and Exercise 7 has a high no. of Missing/Wrong Element errors. For example, Exercise 4 is the first exercise where complexity increases and Patterns have to be recognized. Notice that Wrong Element being use drops in the next two exercises until Exercise 7 which has higher complexity. To summarise, considering the complete list of errors, the frequency of the errors, and the visuals presented above, the outcomes of this analysis as follows. Firstly, within the 6 Formative Exercise # of Errors 0 5 10 15 Ex1 Ex2 Ex3 Ex4 Ex5 Ex6 Ex7 Ex8 Missing Element Wrong Element Missing Pattern Wrong Pattern Fig. 6. Number of distinct errors (per student, per exercise) based on Specification and LOs. error topology itself, the trends emerged helped to optimize the assigned categories in a second iteration. For example specifically in the Priority dimension: (1) When an Error Source belongs to the essential BPMN elements, the priority is high. Every model needs to have the basic elements (basic: start, end, task, event, decision point, pools, and lanes that should be modeled. Missing these or modeling them wrongly results in high-priority errors. (2) The priority is strongly dependent on the earlier classifications: (a) as Patterns involve a group of elements, a pattern error is always a high priority; (b) high-priority errors are more semantic vs. syntactic; (c) The labeling errors are mostly low priority (as they have low weight on scoring) compared to design errors which have low- high priority. (3) In specific cases, some errors have a range of priority based on a certain criterion. For example for the error \u201cMissing Sequence Flow\u201d, the criterion is disruption - priority is low when it is an obvious (harmless) miss and high when it clearly disrupts the process (harmful) and does not match the requirement. Overall, this typology has the potential to be extended to include more LOs, Specifications, Individual Elements, or Patterns. It can indicate which feedback can be highlighted, which learning material could be improved etc. Secondly and more importantly, we gain insight into what are the most common mistakes in each exercise, and the priority of these errors with respect to evaluation, and this can be communicated to students effectively. Thirdly, paired with the data on the Priority dimension, and identifying common mistakes makes it possible for instructors to highlight these errors to students through the feedback videos (which can be updated) and in-person sessions through group feedback. In addition, based on the number of students making errors in specific Patterns can indicate to instructors for which particularly difficult concepts, the time spent in explaining be increased. Instructors can reflect on the content of these exer- cises and what feedback and instruction can benefit students. Lastly, the teaching team would like to note that designing the module with video lectures and developing the online FA exercises required considerable effort in the initial iteration but in the later iterations of the course with only minor changes or updates. Nevertheless, the delivery modality allows students to access the course contents completely whether or not they come to class. A. Limitations This work is an exploratory study with several limitations. The number of FAs is low with exercises having diverse learning objectives. This is a serious limitation as it allows only a reflection on improving the feedback but does not actually measure the effectiveness of the proposed feedback. This could be rectified by having two iterations of exercises interspersed with feedback on modeling. On one hand, with declining numbers in live lecture attendance and procrastina- tion in studying materials of the course, as the FA exercises were only offered optionally to students, on average only 11 out of 43 students provided an actual solution per exercise. It is possible that with a larger sample of student solutions, the error ontology will expand. On the other hand, as this analysis was conducted at the end of the course run, student perspectives could not be included about the utilization and use of FAs in the course. These could be planned in the next course run. As there is no standardized way of assessing the student modeling skill, particularly in courses teaching BPM, the checking process strongly depends on the instructor\u2019s perceptions, perspectives, and idiosyncrasies. This could be a strong influence on the Patterns and errors found. Moreover, the very process of checking complex models is subject to objective criticism. It would be more comprehensive to interview other teaching teams of PM to collect several teacher perspectives on grading student submissions. VI. C ONCLUSION This paper reported on (1) how a facile teaching module can be created for BPM connecting instructional design and teaching PM in a BL context; (2) the possibility of giving 7 feedback on common mistakes and errors in modeling through both feedback videos (online asynchronous) and feedback moments (online and in-person synchronous) to bolster student knowledge; and (3) an exploratory error analysis on models submitted toward FAs by Master\u2019s level students following this module. In this presentation, we limited ourselves to a simple analysis and categorization of errors in finding insights. These insights can be used to improve the course material and feedback given on errors in the next runs of the course thereby helping students understand what they are doing wrong and how can modeling be improved. Due to the blended, facile nature of the course design, it provides several opportunities to further deepen the analysis by giving a second set of FAs with the same LOs as those discussed in this study to measure the effectiveness of feedback. Another direction of future research is to formulate an extensive scoring system to correct the FAs and formalize it with the grading system followed in the SAs as well. We hope that the results and discussion on the use of FA exercises and error ontology in improving feedback will serve as inspiration to incorporate feedback and FAs in creating structured, pedagogically aligned, and, mature learning modules on PM in BL flexible formats.

The term IoT-aware business processesrefers to the inter- play of business processes and Internet of Things concepts. Several stud- ies have been carried out on such a topic, so a better awareness of the current state of knowledge can be bene\ufb01cial. In particular, in a given ap- plication domain, this can help the choice of the most suitable modelling approach. This paper reports on the results of a systematic literature review with the aim of developing a map on modelling notations for IoT- aware business processes. It includes 48 research works from the main computer science digital libraries. We \ufb01rst present a description of the systematic literature review protocol we applied, then we report a list of available notations, discussing their main characteristics. A focus has been devoted to modelling tools and application scenarios. Finally, we provide a discussion on the capability of the identi\ufb01ed modelling nota- tions to represent requirements of scenarios enriched by IoT adequately. 1 Introduction Disruptive innovation introduced by the large adoption of Internet of Things in several sectors (e.g., smart agriculture, smart industry, smart environment) received much attention in recent years. This is mainly due to the capability of the Internet of Things to \ufb01ll the gap between the physical and the digital world, enhancing physical objects with electronic devices. As a side e\ufb00ect, we also observe that complex business processes need to be adapted when electronic devices support foreseen activities. As underlined by theBusiness Processes Meet the Internet-of Things group, and as reported in the manifesto entitled \u201c The Internet-of-Things Meets Business Process Management: Mutual Bene\ufb01ts and Challenges \u201d [24], novel research challenges have to be considered [47]. To face such challenges the research community looks for a suitable modelling language to be used as a lingua franca both for documenting and engineering pre-de\ufb01ned models and for representing models discovered by mining logs of IoT systems. Much e\ufb00ort has been devoted to this topic. However, a better understanding of the current state of knowledge can be helpful to select the most suitable approach to a considered purpose. This paper reports on the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) 1 to organize and synthesize the knowledge about the available notations for mod- 1 All the details of our SLR are available at http://pros.unicam.it/ BP-meet-IoT-2020 2 I. Compagnucci et al. elling IoT-aware business processes. We conducted an SLR to present a fair evaluation of the research works on this topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology [25]. The paper is organized following the phases of the SLR. Sec. 2 reports on the planning phase. Sec. 3 describes the conducting phase providing some insights on the retrieved research works. Sec. 4 answers to the research questions, while Sec. 5 compares our work with related surveys on the topic. Finally, Sec. 6 provides some conclusive remarks. 2 Planning the Systematic Literature Review This section illustrates the steps done to plan the SLR, such as the de\ufb01nition of research questions, the search query, and the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Research Questions. During the planning of our study, we de\ufb01ned one main research question (RQ) and two secondary research questions (SRQ1 and SRQ2). Answers for the secondary research questions are based on scienti\ufb01c works re- trieved for answering the main research question. RQ. Which are the notations used to model IoT-aware business processes? The objective of this question is to gather a list of the available notations that can be used to model business processes integrating IoT concepts. The main characteristics of each notation will be explained with a focus on the actual graphical representation. SRQ1. Which are the available tools supporting the IoT-aware business pro- cess modelling? The objective of this question is to gather a list of available modelling tools that allow designing graphical representations of business pro- cesses including IoT concepts. This aims at investigating the possibility of using the notations in practice. SRQ2. Which are the target application domains for modelling IoT-aware business processes? The objective of this question is to identify which application domains have been already considered in the literature as a target for modelling IoT-aware scenarios. This aims at understanding whether there are domains that will bene\ufb01t more than others from the integration of IoT concepts in a modelling notation. Search Query. After de\ufb01ning the research questions, we carefully planned a search query to \ufb01nd suitable works to answer the research questions. The de\ufb01ni- tion of the query has been based on consolidated recommendations as reported in [4]. In particular, the search query was generated by terms related to three dif- ferent areas: business process, IoT, modelling. It is worth clarifying that among the terms chosen for the query in the IoT area we have also included Cyber Physical System (CPS). This choice is motivated by a NIST research [21], which con\ufb01rms that the terms IoT and CPS are interchangeably used. The resulting search query is reported in Table 1. We applied such a query over \ufb01ve main digital libraries: IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science. We queried the mentioned digital libraries to search the terms of the query into title, abstract, Modelling Notations for IoT-Aware Business Processes 3 Table 1.Search Query. (BPM OR \u201cbusiness process management\u201d OR \u201cbusiness process\u201d) AND (IoT OR \u201cInternet of Things\u201d OR \u201cCyber Physical Systems\u201d OR CPS OR Smart OR WSN OR \u201cWireless Sensor Network\u201d) AND (model OR behavior OR model driven) and keywords. Also, since the combination of business process and IoT concepts is relatively recent, we restricted the query to the last nine years, thus considering all the research works published between January 2011 and September 2019 (when the retrieval process took place). We were con\ufb01dent, anyway, that those paper returned by the query would have referenced possibly relevant research works published before 2011, and then included, if relevant, as result of the snowballing step. Our choice about the time frame is also supported by [21], where 2011 is considered as the starting point for the research activity in the IoT area. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. As part of the protocol implementation, a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria has been de\ufb01ned to guarantee the selection of only relevant research works. We de\ufb01ned two criteria for inclusion:IC.1 - the research work is a primary study; IC.2 - the research work proposes or uses a graphical notation to model IoT-aware business processes. We also considered two criteria for exclusion: EC.1 - the research work is not written in the English Language; EC.2 - the research work does not propose and does not refer to any notation to model IoT-aware business processes. 3 Conducting the Systematic Literature Review This section describes how we performed the review. In particular, we provide details related to the identi\ufb01cation and selection activities of the research works, and we report the categories used to classify them. Identi\ufb01cation and Selection of the Research Works.From the application of the search query over the digital libraries, we identi\ufb01ed 1321 research works potentially relevant for the research topic. The selection steps we applied are illustrated in Fig. 1. Through a careful analysis of the title and abstract of these research works, we identi\ufb01ed 92 relevant works. After the removal of 53 duplicates, the remaining 39 research works were read and analyzed for a \ufb01nal selection. The \ufb01nal number of research works obtained by applying the search query, and after having analyzed them, is 23. To improve the accuracy of our review, we also applied Snowballing [23]. It consists of analysing all the research works that mention or are mentioned 1. Apply Search query 2. Read Title and Abstract 3. Remove duplicates 4. Read and Analyze entire paper 5.

The snowballing allows \ufb01nding research works potentially relevant for our study that have not been found with the query technique previously used. We used both backward and forward snowballing: we analysed in the \ufb01rst case, all the referenced research works, while in the second case, all the works that refer to those we selected. This step was not limited to the considered time frame, to have a comprehensive picture on related research, possibly including also contributions antecedent 2011. With the \ufb01rst execution of the snowballing, we found 15 new research works; we stopped at the fourth iteration of the snowballing. The entire snowballing procedure added 25 research works to the 23 selected with the search query for a total of 48 relevant research works retrieved. Fig. 2 reports how many research works out of the total 48 can be found querying each digital library. From this analysis, we can say that Scopus and Web of Science appear to be the most suitable digital libraries for such a topic. They include 41 (85%) and 32 (67%) of the total 48 research works, respectively. The results for the other digital libraries are IEEE Xplore 17 (35%), Science Direct 7 (14.5%), ACM Digital Library 5 (10.4%). It is worth mentioning that 2 works (one conference research works and a deliverable) (4.2%) could not be found searching in those libraries. Fig. 3 reports a diagram showing a classi\ufb01cation of the di\ufb00erent venues from which the research works were selected during the literature review, grouped by year of publication. The majority of the works have been presented at Confer- ences 34 (70.8%) or published in Journals 13 (27.1%). Among the selected works, we also found a Deliverable (2.1%) worth to be considered, since it was refer- enced by several of the reviewed scienti\ufb01c works. Moreover, from 2010 to 2019 there has always been at least one contribution related to the analysed topic, with a peak of 8 papers in 2018. This testi\ufb01es that the research community has been active on the selected research topic and that the interest seems to increase in recent years. As we can see, more than 50% of the works have been published from 2016 and 2019. It is worth noticing a possible decrease in interest in 2019. However, this could be because, at the time of the search, some of the research works published (or under publication) in late 2019 were not indexed, yet. Modelling Notations for IoT-Aware Business Processes 5 Data Extraction and Synthesis. To retrieve the necessary data to answer the research questions, we de\ufb01ned the structure of Table 2 to guide the extraction of data out of the retrieved research works. It presents the following columns: Source reports the reference to the research work; Modelling Notation reports the name of the modelling notation used/proposed or the name of the authors if no name has been assigned to the notation; Modelling Tool refers to the tool used to design a process model;Notation Usage tells whether the notation is used just to design a business process model related to an IoT application scenario or whether it is also used to guide the implementation and execution of such a process; Application Domain refers to the domain of the process represented by the modelling notation. To categorize the application domains we referred to the well-known classi\ufb01cation proposed in [2], which groups IoT domains in: health- care, environmental, smart city, commercial, industrial, and general aspects. 4 Results of the Systematic Literature Review This section illustrates the data we extracted to answer our research questions. Answer to RQ.To answer to research question RQ - Which are the notations used to model IoT-aware business processes? - we grouped the notation that emerged from the literature in three classes: Not-BPMN, BPMN, and BPMN extension. As it can be seen in Table 2, only 4 (8.3%) out of the 48 identi\ufb01ed research works presented a notation to model IoT-aware business processes that are not related to BPMN; 14 (29.2%) of the identi\ufb01ed research works make usage of the BPMN 2.0 notation as it is; 30 (62.5%) of the identi\ufb01ed research works propose or use an extension of BPMN 2.0. Some of those works make usage of BPMN only for the design of business process models (D), others propose entire architectures and frameworks based on BPMN and related tools so to enable the execution phase (E). Not-BPMN. All approaches that do not use BPMN focus on the design phase except for [46] in which the authors propose Context-Adaptive Petri-Net (CAPN) a tool-supported formalism to construct Petri nets that are context- adaptive. In [49] the authors use CAPN for acquiring IoT-awareness in an indus- trial application. In [17] the authors use Cooperative Task Language (CoTaL), a subject-oriented and task-based approach for specifying activities in smart sce- narios. In [16] the authors use Subject-Oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM), a modelling paradigm using a standard semantics of natural language with subjects, predicates, and objects to describe business processes of a smart environment; the Subject Behavior Diagram is generated for each subject in- volved in the business process to de\ufb01ne its interactions with other subjects in the process. BPMN. This category refers to all the research works that perceive BPMN, as it is, adequate in capturing process speci\ufb01cations of IoT scenarios; this means that they represent IoT aspects by means of the standard BPMN elements. In the following, we \ufb01rst report the research works that make use of BPMN mainly 6 I. Compagnucci et al.

In [6] the authors use BPMN to capture IoT scenarios and propose to trans- form such models into code to be executed on a sensor network. In [15] the authors represent, by means of BPMN annotations attached to a pool, con- ditions that must always be valid within an IoT process. In [12] the authors propose a way to adapt an already available IoT platform to the needs of the BPM approach and analyse the di\ufb03culties that arise therein using BPMN in the design phase. In [48] the authors propose a framework to connect the IoT infras- tructure to the context-aware BPM ecosystem using IoT-integrated ontologies and IoT-enhanced decision models, which enable the capabilities of IoT to make Modelling Notations for IoT-Aware Business Processes 7 business processes modelled via BPMN and the involved decision making aware of the dynamic context. In [14] and [29] the authors directly focus on IoT and business processes, proposing \ufb01rst to use BPMN to model IoT scenarios, then to transform the models into an intermediate language, such as Callas Byte Code, to describe WSN systems, and \ufb01nally to execute such code on the IoT devices. In [30] the authors use BPMN as a starting point to model IoT scenarios managed by BPM Systems, proposing an architecture for decentralised device-to-device business process execution over mobile nodes. In [18] the authors presented a contribution that allows to coordinate the devices used in an IoT application by means of a business process engine with the design of BPMN models for the process logic. In [31] the authors focus on monitoring the compliance of the execution of multi-party business processes. They exploit the IoT paradigm by instructing smart objects. The scenario is modelled in BPMN, then trans- lated into a set of artifact-centric process models, rendered in another notation called Extended-GSM. In [45] the authors introduce an integrated approach for IoT-aware business process execution that exploits IoT for BPM with a partic- ular focus on the management of IoT data. In [37] the authors use BPMN for and controlling the maintenance procedure in a scenario of an industrial cyber- physical production environment. In [57] the authors propose an architecture for a smart home service. Home business processes are analyzed and classi\ufb01ed, and then a BPMN-based home business process method is presented. In [41] the authors propose a model based on BPM paradigm, and IT principles to model and enhance the process of a speci\ufb01c scenario. BPMN Extensions. In this category are reported all the research works presenting extensions to the BPMN notation for better representing IoT as- pects in a designed model. We can see that in some cases the same BPMN extension is used (i.e., IAPM [35], uBPMN [59], BPMN4WSN [8]) and in turn extended (see, e.g., [32,58,51]). Looking at the various extensions proposed to the BPMN notation, we observed that none of them presents a completely new element, but they present characterizations of already available ones 2. Several BPMN elements have been extended, such as Activities, Events, Data Objects, Pool/Lanes, and Gateways. IoT concepts like Sensing and Actuating are often represented using tasks: Actuator task is a physical task performed by an IoT device, while Sensing task indicates the retrieval of data from the physical world by a sensor. Data produced by IoT devices are represented using Smart data objects or Stream Data objects; they represent, either an input or an output, the data \ufb02ow generally produced by IoT devices. Also, the mobility aspect, which characterizes some IoT devices, is represented using location markers added to Events or Pools/Lanes. Besides, it is worth noticing that only a few of the re- search works proposing a BPMN extension also provide approaches to execute the model designed with such a notation.

For presentation purpose, we collected those data in the form of diagram reported in Fig. 4. We can see that 22 of the research works (45.8%) do not refer to any modelling tool that can be used to model IoT-aware business processes; 3 research works (6.25%) do not use BPMN and refer to dedicated tools; 9 research works (18.75%) make use of the BPMN notation without extending it but referring to standard modelling editors; 14 research works (29.2%) present a BPMN extension devel- oped by adding new elements to the ones available in existing modelling editors. It results that for what concerns BPMN extensions for modelling IoT aspects, many of the proposed notations are limited to the conceptualization of an exten- sion and do not provide any editor for actually being used. Usually, those that provide an editor refer to custom extensions of already available editors, which in many cases are not made available or are deprecated. Column Application Domain in Table 2 permits to answer the research ques- tion SRQ2 - Which are the target application domains for the modelling of IoT- aware business processes? For presentation purpose, we collected those data in a form of chart reported in Fig. 5. The application domains referred by the re- trieved research works are: commercial (31.3%); smart city (29.2%); industrial (18.8%); healthcare (8.3%); general aspects (6.3%); environmental (4.2%). Only one of the research works (2.1%) does not refer to any application domain. 5 Related Work While scouting the literature for retrieving scienti\ufb01c contributions concerning the modelling of IoT-aware business processes, we found some research works that, while being di\ufb00erent, share the spirit of our work. IBM provided a report [5] targeting the modelling of IoT-aware business pro- cesses. It gives, not in the form of a systematic literature review, an overview of some BPMN extensions used to incorporate IoT aspects in business process models. They describe extensions published in the period 2010-2018, which result in being a subset of those we retrieved from our study. In [9] the authors provide, not in the form of a systematic literature review, an analysis of existing BPMSs for IoT frameworks and identify the limitations, and their drawbacks based on a Mobile Cloud Computing perspective. They also provide a summary of some of the BPMN extensions used to incorporate IoT aspects in business process mod- els. These extensions are a subset of those we retrieved from our study published Modelling Notations for IoT-Aware Business Processes 9 in the period 2012-2016. The authors of [54] performed a systematic mapping study that investigates the modelling and automatic code generation initiatives for wireless sensor network applications based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Even though this work presents a signi\ufb01cant amount of retrieved research works, it di\ufb00ers from ours on the query, which is kept more general, also including terms referring to Model Driven Engineering. Besides, their contribution focuses on aspects linked to the technology used by the various approaches, the kind of supported middleware, the proposed service-oriented architecture. However, while limiting the notation comparison on the support for aspects linked to WSN (e.g. energy consumption), they miss some less speci\ufb01c notations, which we re- trieved, and that target IoT in general. Moreover, the modelling notations that they identi\ufb01ed have been published in the period 2005-2015, so not including more recent works. In [3], the authors provide a survey, not in the form of a systematic literature review, on domain-speci\ufb01c BPMN extensions. Their work is, therefore, more general and less precise on the topic of modelling IoT-aware business processes, resulting in a subset of the notations we identi\ufb01ed. Their research only covers the period 2007-2014. 6 Concluding Remarks In this paper, we performed an SLR on modelling notations for IoT-aware busi- ness processes using the Kitchenham guidelines. We organize the work in sections re\ufb02ecting the followed SLR protocol: planning (Sec. 2), conducting (Sec. 3), and reporting (Sec. 4). We selected and analyzed 48 research works. The results con- \ufb01rmed the increasing relevance of the considered topic, witnessed by the increase in the number of the published research works on the subject till 2018. Answering our research questions, we recognized that modelling notations for IoT-aware business processes result to be a hot topic from the BP-meet- IoT community. However, during our study, we observed the lack of a notation suitable to support all the IoT related requirements (reported in [35]) that are typically used by the community as a reference point for comparing IoT-aware business process notations. In this regard, while analyzing the various contri- butions, we synthesized an overview of the IoT requirements supported by the emerged notations. In Table 3 we present as columns the IoT requirements and as rows the identi\ufb01ed notations (note that we group research works referring to the same notation). The comparison shows that almost all extensions inte- grate the RQ1. Entity Based Concept requirement. Other requirements, such as RQ2. Distributed Execution , RQ3. Interactions, RQ4. Distributed Data , RQ6. Abstraction, RQ9. Flexibility - Event based , and RQ11. Real Time are met by most of the proposed extensions. Other requirements, such as RQ5. Scalability, RQ7. Availability - Mobility , RQ8. Fault Tolerance and the RQ10. Uncertainty of information are requirements not met by existing extensions. This is because these requirements refer to data management, and most extensions avoid deal- ing with data. As a \ufb01nal consideration, we can see that none of the identi\ufb01ed notations fully meets the IoT requirements. 10 I. Compagnucci et al.

This paper reports a systematic literature review to develop a map on modeling no- tations for IoT-Aware business processes. The survey mainly adopts an academic point of view, resulting in the detailed analysis of 84 research works from the lead- ing computer science digital libraries. The output of the review is in the form of schemes and reflections. In particular, our research aims to shed light on (i) the relevant modeling views referring to different types of IoT-Aware business processes; (ii) the IoT requirements supported by the modeling notations; and (iii) the mod- eling notations proposed and/or adopted to model IoT- Aware business processes. Finally, our research work highlights possible future research lines needing further investigations. Keywords IoT-Aware Business Process \u00b7 IoT \u00b7 Business Process Management \u00b7 Modeling Notation 1 Introduction Nowadays, we are witnessing continuous growth in adopt- ing IoT devices and, consequently, IoT-based applica- tions. Disruptive innovations have been introduced in several sectors such as agriculture, industries, and city management with the rising relevance of smart agricul- ture, smart industry, and smart city sectors [4]. CISCO estimates that \u201cthe number of devices connected to IP networks will be more than three times the global popu- lation by 2023. [...] There will be 29.3 billion networked devices by 2023, up from 18.4 billion in 2018\u201d [25]. This is mainly due to the capability of the IoT to create a link between the physical world and the digital one, es- pecially by making physical objects accessible and avail- able to end-users at any time. The merging of physical and digital worlds enables monitoring real phenomena 2 Ivan Compagnucci1 et al. based on sensing data, and the consequent possibility of actuating choices based on such data. As a consequence, organizations\u2019 business processes ask to be aligned in a way to take advantage of IoT capabilities [83], and the notion of \u201cIoT-Aware business process\u201d is becoming prominent in all the sectors in which IoT technologies have been introduced [10, 19, 20, 58, 83]. More effective integration of business processes and IoT-related topics has been recognized as a win-win sit- uation, making it possible for both IoT and business processes to overcome their natural limitations [69]. However, as suggested by the Business Processes Meet the Internet-of Things group and its manifest, integrat- ing IoT and business processes poses challenges to the research community that, among various things, ask for appropriate modeling notations [61]. This increased the research community\u2019s interest in proposing several modeling notations. In recent years, many proposals have been defined to support model- ing such IoT-Aware business processes. This also led to the publication of surveys on the topic [10, 17, 41, 51, 108, 110]. Such works are meritorious and permitted to shed light on different aspects of such integration. However, they refer to a reduced time frame (2009 - 2020), they do not illustrate how the different notations support relevant IoT modeling views and IoT-related requirements, and none of the mentioned surveys pro- vides guidelines for selecting an approach based on the specific needs of a given application scenario (see Sec- tion 7 for further details). This paper describes the procedure we adopted for conducting our Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and reports on its results, emphasizing research works in the academic literature. To present a fair evalua- tion of the research works on this topic, we conducted the SLR using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology following the guidelines suggested by Kitchen- ham et al. [64]. The conducted study is based on the following re- search questions. They have been defined based on an overview of the literature and the experience of the au- thors who have been researching this and related topics for some years. \u2013 RQ1. What are the relevant modeling views to con- sider when modeling IoT-Aware business processes? \u2013 RQ2. What are the IoT requirements supported by the modeling notations used to model IoT-Aware busi- ness processes? \u2013 RQ3. What are the modeling notations proposed and/or adopted to model IoT-Aware business processes? By answering the listed research questions, the pa- per targets: (i)researchers/academics, by providing them with a list of possible future research directions re- garding the modeling of IoT-Aware business processes; (ii) tool builders, by clarifying the maturity of the sup- porting modeling environments that could suggest the development of novel tools or the improvement of those already available; and (iii) practitioners, by providing a list of the available notations for modeling IoT-Aware business processes that could guide them in selecting the most appropriate notation according to the sup- ported views and requirements. This work is an extension of the paper \u201cModelling Notations for IoT-Aware Business Processes: A System- atic Literature Review\u201d [27], published in the proceed- ings of the 4th International Workshop on BP-Meet- IoT. Besides describing the method we followed in greater detail, this article extends the scope of the original con- ference paper. In particular, this paper: \u2013 is based on a different search query that considers a different time frame and different research ques- tions, whose objective is to investigate additional findings related to modeling views, IoT requirements, and tools availability; \u2013 reports and analyses 36 additional research works (for a total of 84); \u2013 includes a cross-cutting analysis of the data retrieved to answer the research questions, and it underlines how the different findings refer to each other. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 de- scribes the methodology we applied. Section 3 discusses the research questions and the search strategy we adopted. Section 4 describes the application of the protocol and gives an overview of the obtained results that are then detailed in Section 5. Section 6 contains a discussion on the results. Related works are presented in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper, reporting our main contribution. 2 Methodology In this paper, to perform a systematic literature re- view according to a well-established protocol, we refer to the methodology proposed by Kitchenham et al. [64]. This methodology is structured over three phases to be performed in chronological order and structured as pre- sented below. \u2013 Planning - This phase refers to the definition of a clear reviewing protocol. It requires to precisely define the objective of the SLR, clearly state a set of research questions, derive a query to be submitted to digital libraries, select a list of digital libraries to be used for retrieving relevant research works, A Systematic Literature Review on IoT-Aware Business Process Modeling Views, Requirements and Notations 3 and then to clearly define the inclusion/exclusion criteria needed to filter the list of research works retrieved from the digital libraries. \u2013 Conducting - This phase focuses on performing the search activity and analyzing the retrieved re- search works. The search step consists of submitting the defined search query to the specified digital li- braries and collecting the research papers returned by the query. All the retrieved papers are then scru- tinized, and the inclusion/exclusion criteria are ap- plied. The result of this step is the identification of the first set of relevant papers. In this phase, it is possible to extend the corpus of relevant papers by applying additional techniques such as backward and forward snowballing [60, 113]. These techniques require analyzing each paper\u2019s reference section to identify additional relevant papers (backward) or to use digital libraries to identify papers that cite one of the papers already judged relevant (forward). The exclusion/inclusion criteria also have to be ap- plied to filter the research works identified, using the snowballing procedure to keep only relevant papers in the considered set. Finally, data extraction is per- formed from the identified set of relevant research works. This step generally results in the definition of a possible classification and clustering of the identi- fied papers, and it requires organizing the retrieved information to answer the identified research ques- tions. \u2013 Reporting - This phase involves writing up the re- view results to effectively communicate them by il- lustrating the answers to the research questions. 3 Planning the Systematic Literature Review This section illustrates the steps to plan the SLR, such as the definition of the research questions and the adopted search strategy. 3.1 Research Questions Our research questions resulted from a set of brain- storming sessions carried out by the authors. In partic- ular, the brainstorming activity has been preceded by analysis and reflection on some relevant research works such as [10, 17, 41, 51, 108, 110], as well as the BP-meet- IoT manifesto [61]. The outcome of the brainstorming has been summarized in the following research ques- tions: \u2013 RQ1. What are the relevant modeling views to con- sider when modeling IoT-Aware business processes? The question focuses on the possibility of highlight- ing different views considering the type of IoT-Aware business processes representing either the behavior of single IoT devices or the one of the whole appli- cation. \u2013 RQ2. What are the IoT requirements supported by the modeling notations used to model IoT-Aware busi- ness processes? This question aims to define the alignment of each modeling notation with IoT-related requirements. \u2013 RQ3. What are the modeling notations proposed and/or adopted to model IoT-Aware business processes? This question aims to provide an insight into the available notations that can be used to model busi- ness processes integrating IoT concepts. The main characteristics of each notation will be explained with a focus on the actual graphical representation. In answering this question, the following additional sub-questions have been identified. \u2013 RQ3.1. Which are the considered application do- mains used to study and validate the proposed notations? This question aims to define which application domains are commonly used to show the charac- teristics of the considered notation. \u2013 RQ3.2. What is the maturity of the tool support- ing the modeling of IoT-Aware process? This question aims to check if a proposed nota- tion is supported by an associated modeling tool and what is the maturity level of such a tool. \u2013 RQ3.3. What are the notations used to support the enactment of IoT-Aware business processes? This question aims to check if the considered no- tations can be used only to support the design of IoT-Aware business processes or whether they also support enactment activities. 3.2 Search strategy This section provides details on the adopted strategy to collect relevant research works from the literature, mainly focusing on the search query, the selection of the involved digital libraries, the criteria used to include or exclude research works from the survey, and finally on the snowballing step. Search Query. After defining the research ques- tions, we carefully planned a search query for scouting the literature. The query definition is based on con- solidated recommendations as reported in Brereton et al. [9]. Especially, we identified three main areas which our questions refer to: Business Process Management , Internet of Things , and Modeling. Starting from these areas, we identified relevant terms to be included in 4 Ivan Compagnucci1 et al. our query. The words used for the search query were thought up and discussed through brainstorming among the paper authors. We did various iterations between the authors before agreeing on the final set of terms reported in Table 1, and discussed in the following. Referring to the area of Business Process Manage- ment we included the terms: BPM, business process*, intelligent process* and workflow*. In the selection, we include BPM to refer to the whole field of study, and business process since it is the focus of our research, and the term directly comes from the research questions. We also add intelligent process referring to the capability of the process enriched by IoT to become smart. Finally, we include workflow since the Workflow Management Coalition consortium initially used it to equally refer to a business process [57]. In the area of Internet of Things we included the terms: IoT, Internet of Thing*, Internet of Everything*, Web of Thing* , Cyber Physical System* , CPS, Sen- sor Network*, WSN, Context Aware*. In the selection, we include the Internet of Things since it is the fo- cus of our research, and the Internet of Everything , the Web of Things , and the sensor networks since are terms directly related to IoT. At the same time, we have included Cyber Physical System which is often in- terchangeably used for IoT, as suggested by the NIST research [12, 53]. We also include WSN, which stands for Wireless Sensor Networks, since there are research works considering WSN applications as IoT applica- tions without distinguishing them [71]. Finally, we add in this area the combined term Context Aware, which is commonly considered a relevant property of IoT en- vironments. Considering the area of Modeling we included the terms: Model*, Behavio*, Diagram*. We include model since it is the focus of our research. We also include behavior/behaviour since it can express the concept of an operating mechanism connected to a model. Finally, the choice of integrating diagram is motivated by the fact that it is the result of the modeling activity. Upon the identified terms, we constructed the search query, using the logical disjunction connective (\u201cOR\u201d) to connect terms of the same area, and the logical con- junction connective (\u201cAND\u201d) to join the sets of terms of the different areas.1 Digital Libraries.After having specified the query, we selected the digital libraries to be used, and the choice fell on the three most commonly used in the area 1 It is also worth clarifying that the * character is used to include in our search any word that starts with the string of characters preceding the *. For example, by specifying busi- ness process* allows us also to include business processes; Cyber Physical System*allows us to include Cyber Physical Systems; model* allows us to include models. of Information System and Computer Science: Scopus, Web of Science, and AIS eLibrary. Interestingly Web of Science and Scopus usually index articles from other popular digital libraries such as IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digital Library. For this reason, we decided not to include the latter two. In addition, we also defined the fields in which the used digital libraries should look for a match of the specified query. We restricted the query to title, abstract, and keywords. This means that if a combination of one term for the areas of Business Process modeling, Internet of Things, and Modeling is present in the title, in the abstract or in the keywords list of research work, that research work will be part of the query results. Moreover, we defined a time frame to limit the results returned by the query. We chose to start the search from 1999, which is considered the year of birth of the term Internet of Things [5], and to end with the year 2020 to have stabilized data at the time when the SLR has been conducted. Notice that as the term \u201cIoT\u201d does not appear in the literature before 1999, we decided to consider such a year as the starting date for selecting relevant works. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. As part of the protocol implementation, a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria has been defined to guarantee the selection of relevant research works. In particular, we consider two inclusion and one exclusion criteria as described in the following. IC.1 Criterion states \u201c the research work has to be a primary study \u201d. The objective is to in- clude only research works proposing novel solutions and not reviewing available literature. In particular, in the following, the term \u201cresearch work\u201d is used only for primary studies. EC.1 Criterion states \u201cthe research work is not written in English language \u201d. EC.2 Cri- terion states \u201cthe research work does not propose, and does not refer to any modeling notation for IoT-Aware business processes\u201d. Some works resulting from the search activity were not directly related to the topic under study; for instance, papers related to non-process-oriented modeling notation were excluded. Moreover, modeling approaches that were not directly related to the Inter- net of Things world were not considered. 4 Conducting the Systematic Literature Review This section describes how we performed the SLR. In particular, we provide details related to the research works\u2019 identification, selection, and reporting activities. In addition, we discuss the categories used to classify them. A Systematic Literature Review on IoT-Aware Business Process Modeling Views, Requirements and Notations 5 BPM (BPM OR \u201cbusiness process*\u201d OR \u201cintelligent process*\u201d OR \u201cworkflow*\u201d) AND (IoT OR \u201cInternet of Thing*\u201d OR \u201cInternet of Everything*\u201d OR \u201cWeb of Thing*\u201d OR \u201cCyber Physical System*\u201d OR CPS OR WSN OR \u201cSensor Network*\u201d OR \u201cContext Aware\u201d) AND (Model* OR Behavio* OR Diagram*) IoT Model Table 1: Search query terms by domains 4.1 Identification and selection of the research works As a result of the search protocol, 84 relevant research works have been identified. Figure 1 reports the selec- tion steps we applied in a BPMN diagram. From the application of the search query over the digital libraries we collect 2609 research works poten- tially relevant for the research topic - Scopus (1352), Web of Science (858) and AIS eLibrary (399). Then, after having applied IC.1 and EC.1, we deleted the duplicates from this initial set, and we noticed that 47% of the initially identified research works were duplicates (1235); their removal from the initial set resulted in 1374 unique research works. After removing the duplicates, we read the title and abstract of the remaining 1374 research works. The ob- jective of this phase was to determine the most appro- priate works for our research. In particular, applying the exclusion criterion EC.2, we removed many papers as already from the reading of the title, and the ab- stract was clear that no new proposal and no notation for IoT-Aware BP were referred to in such papers. After this step, we kept 182 works in the set. Successively, we entirely read and analyzed the papers still considering the exclusion criterion EC.2, and we reduced to 68 the research works considered relevant for our review. Finally, to improve the review\u2019s accuracy and vali- date the selection done on research works, we apply the snowballing technique [60, 113] starting from the 68 pa- pers left. The snowballing technique can be applied for multiple iterations, and it was reapplied on the rele- vant papers discovered during the previous snowballing iteration. With the first iteration of the snowballing, we found 16 additional research works (7 backward and 9 for- ward); we stopped at the second iteration of the snow- balling since no other relevant papers were found. We used a Google worksheet to categorize and classify the research work resulting from the liter- ature during the research. The worksheet is avail- able online athttp://pros.unicam.it/BP-meet-IoT/ Modeling-SLR2020. The worksheet is divided into tabs, each containing relevant information: the All tab in- cludes general information such as title, publication year, publication venue, and publication type (confer- ence, workshop, journal, or other). We also included other tabs for each question and sub-questions. To fill such a tab, we selected multiple-choice fields after a content analysis step according to the data extraction and synthesis described in the next section. 4.2 Data extraction and synthesis The data extraction and synthesis steps aim to design a suitable form to record and collect the relevant infor- mation from reading the selected research works. At- tributes included in the multiple-choice questions RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3, and the sub-questions RQ3.1, RQ3.2, and RQ3.3 were selected after a content analysis step. General and multiple-choice fields are summarized in Table 2. To answer the research question RQ1 - What are the relevant modeling views to consider when modeling IoT-Aware business processes? We selected the follow- ing attributes referring to the classification proposed by Maamar et al. [69]. \u2013 Process of Things (PoT).This class includes re- search works on the usage of business process mod- eling notations to design the internal behaviors of IoT devices and their cooperation. \u2013 Things-aware process (TaP).This class includes research works referring to the usage of business pro- cess modeling notations to design business processes integrating IoT devices into the IT system, result- ing in complementary components within the work system. To answer the research question RQ2 - What are the IoT requirements supported by the modeling nota- tions used to model IoT-Aware business processes? We selected the following attributes that have been defined by the IoT-A European Project [83, 84], which is gen- erally regarded as one of the pioneering collaborative activities on IoT-Aware business processes. \u2013 R.1 - Entity-based concept. This class includes research works discussing modeling notations to rep- resent the various real-world entities, with their characteristics, involved in an IoT-Aware business process. \u2013 R.2 - Distributed execution. This class includes research works discussing modeling notations to de- scribe how activities execution is distributed over 6 Ivan Compagnucci1 et al. 1.

RQ 3.3 Design Only, Enactment/Execution. Table 2: Attributes for data extraction the multitude of heterogeneous IoT devices and re- lated IoT-Aware software systems presenting differ- ent characteristics to be optimized (like the energy consumption) [34]. \u2013 R.3 - Interactions. This class includes research works presenting how to represent the interactions among many IoT devices and software components related to IoT software systems. IoT devices cannot be seen as isolated; they act synergically, communi- cating and interacting with each other to achieve the business goals that guide the behavior of an IoT sys- tem. In particular, we refer to the interaction modal- ities considering protocols like HTTP, MQTT, Wi- Fi, Bluetooth, and their characteristics (e.g., the re- sponse time). \u2013 R.4 - Distributed data. This class includes re- search works on representing data and describing how data are produced, consumed, and distributed in IoT devices. The entities involved in IoT-Aware processes are seen as prosumers of high quantity and variety of data. Such data can be stored and dis- tributed across the involved entities (e.g., many IoT devices can store information thanks to their inter- nal storage system or use the cloud, while other data may be entirely discarded). \u2013 R.5 - Scalability. This class includes research works considering notations supporting the repre- sentation of expected performance, also when the number of involved entities can vary. This enables the maintenance of the IoT-Aware software system performance while offering the possibility of insert- ing new IoT devices, if necessary. \u2013 R.6 - Abstraction. This class includes research works presenting modeling notations able to provide a different level of abstraction, representing low- level details of the various involved entities. How- ever, it should also be able to abstract from them, A Systematic Literature Review on IoT-Aware Business Process Modeling Views, Requirements and Notations 7 providing a higher perspective over higher-level as- pects related to the entire integration process. \u2013 R.7 - Availability/Mobility. This class includes research works considering modeling notations able to represent the mobile nature of IoT devices, which can sometimes make them unavailable, leading to the impossibility of performing actions that depend on them. \u2013 R.8 - Fault tolerance. This class includes research works considering modeling notations able to repre- sent the handling of faulty situations. Indeed, while using data retrieved from IoT devices to guide the execution of a process, it is important to determine ways to manage failures (that may be due, e.g., to the IoT device\u2019s unavailability) to invalidate the whole process. \u2013 R.9 - Flexibility/Event-based. This class in- cludes research works considering modeling nota- tions to design context-adaptive business processes that vary depending on occurring events. We refer to modeling notations considering events that can happen at any time due to certain conditions. \u2013 R.10 - Uncertainty of information. This class includes research works describing the information sources and defining their reliability. This is par- ticularly important since the information accuracy differs strongly according to the IoT devices. \u2013 R.11 - Real-time. This class includes research works discussing modeling notations suitable to ex- press time constraints based on which IoT-Aware business process activities have to occur. This means dealing with time-based modeling elements that, for example, can trigger an action in a specific period. To answer the research questionRQ3 - What are the modeling notations proposed and/or adopted to model IoT-Aware business processes? We collected and in- spected all the notations reported in the analyzed lit- erature and categorized them based on three clusters that emerged from our analysis. \u2013 BPMN 2.0. This class includes research works using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)2 to model IoT-Aware business processes. BPMN is considered the \u201cde facto\u201d standard for modeling business processes. \u2013 Not-BPMN.This class includes research works us- ing already defined notations or proposing novel no- tations to model IoT-Aware business processes that are not related to BPMN. \u2013 BPMN Extension. This class includes research works extending BPMN with IoT-specific stereo- types. In this class, we include three types of ex- 2 https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0 tension: (i) Meta-Model Only extensions referring to those research papers that extend the standard meta-model of the BPMN with new attributes, en- tities, and relations without changing the graphi- cal part; (ii) Graphical Only extensions referring to those research papers that add graphical notation elements over the BPMN standard; and (iii) Meta- Model and Graphical extensions referring to those research papers combing both types of extensions. To answer the research sub-questionRQ3.1 - Which are the considered application domains used to study and validate the proposed notations? We selected the following attributes coming from a well-known classifi- cation proposed by Asghari et al. [4]. \u2013 Healthcare. This class includes research works considering healthcare as a reference application do- main to integrate IoT, to move from a traditional model where treatments take place only in hospi- tal centers to a new one, where care is accessible anywhere. \u2013 Environmental.This class includes research works considering the environment as a reference applica- tion domain to model aspects regarding the con- tinuous control of the environment (e.g., pollution levels) to try to keep it under control environmental conditions and possibly send alarm signals. \u2013 Smart City. This class includes research works considering the smart city as a reference applica- tion domain to have a smarter utilization and de- ployment of public resources, better efficiency of services, better quality of life, and the reduction of waste and costs for the public administration. This class also includes works related to smart buildings and smart homes. \u2013 Commercial. This class includes research works considering commercial applications as a reference domain to use IoT to improve the customer experi- ence and the services offered. \u2013 Industrial. This class includes research works con- sidering industrial applications as reference domain to use IoT to improve working conditions, ensur- ing safer machines and tracking real-time goods; at the same time, creates new business models and an efficient and secure supply chain, and flexible and adaptive production processes, intending to increase the productivity. \u2013 General. This class includes research works that do not consider a specific application domain or do not fit within any of the already introduced classes. To answer the research sub-question RQ3.2. What is the maturity of the tool supporting the modeling 8 Ivan Compagnucci1 et al. of IoT-Aware process? We selected the following at- tributes considering the tools used in the selected re- search works. \u2013 Mature Prototype. This class includes research works proposing notations supported by ready-to- use and well-validated modeling environments and tools. \u2013 Early Prototype. This class includes research works proposing notations that are supported by early tool prototypes that are still in an early ver- sion. \u2013 No Provided Tool.This class includes research works that do not discuss modeling environments and tools. To answer the research sub-question RQ3.3 What are the notations used to support the enactment of IoT- Aware business processes? We selected the following at- tributes. \u2013 Design Only.This class includes research works providing notations and languages with the only aim of representing IoT-Aware business processes. \u2013 Enactment/Execution. This class includes re- search works considering notations that support the design of IoT-Aware business processes up to their actual enactment/execution at run-time. According to the identified relevant attributes, the classification of the research works required us to ap- ply an iterative approach that permitted us to refine our findings after having considered each research pa- per at least three times. At each iteration, a reader and a reviewer were identified among the authors. The first one read the paper and provided a report, while the re- viewer checked, after having read the paper, if he/she was in line with the report. Finally, all disagreements were solved through discussions. 5 Reporting of the Systematic Literature Review This section first illustrates some general remarks over the 84 identified research works, then focuses on the data extracted for answering the research questions. 5.1 General remarks on collected works and data We collected information regarding the publication type of the research work (i.e., Conference, Journal, Deliverable). Table 3 shows the distribution concern- ing the venue type of the relevant papers selected for the research, and it groups the research works by year of publication. Most of the works in the resulting final selection have been presented at conferences or pub- lished in journals. Among the selected works, we also found one project deliverable [83] that we considered worthy of inclusion since it was referenced by several of the reviewed scientific works. Notice that the 84 papers are published in more than 70 venues, and according to our selection, we can conclude that there are no consoli- dated target venues. Figure 2 reports those conferences and journals in which some selected research works ap- peared more frequently. The most common journals related to the selected papers are Software and Sys- tems Modeling 3, Information Systems 4 and Sensors5. Regarding conferences, the most common venues are Business Process Management 6, Services Computing 7 and Internet of Things 8. SoSyM Information Systems Sensors BPM Services Computing Internet of Things 0 1 2 3 Journal Conference Fig. 2: Papers distribution by main events or journals Moreover, considering publication distribution over the years, it is worth noticing that no relevant papers emerged before 2010. As we can see, more than 60% of the works were published between 2016 and 2020. Furthermore, there has always been at least one contri- bution related to the considered topic every year, with a peak of 12 papers in 2017. This testifies that the research community has been actively modeling IoT- Aware business processes and that the interest seems to increase in recent years. 3 https://www.sosym.org/ 4 https://www.editorialmanager.com/infosys 5 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors 6 https://www.bpm-conference.org/ 7 https://www.servicessociety.org/scc 8 https://www.iot-conference.org/ A Systematic Literature Review on IoT-Aware Business Process Modeling Views, Requirements and Notations 9 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 # of research works (%) Conference 1 6 5 3 4 5 6 7 7 8 4 56 (67%) Journal - - - - 2 3 4 5 4 3 6 27 (32%) Deliverable - 1 - - - - - - - - - 1 (1%) Total 1 7 5 3 6 8 10 12 11 11 10 84 Table 3: Amount of research works divided by publication type and year (the dash (-) symbol denotes that no research work of that kind has been retrieved for that year) 5.2 Relevant modeling views to consider when modeling IoT-Aware business processes (RQ1) The research question RQ1 wants to clarify the relevant modeling views to consider when modeling IoT-Aware business processes, mainly focusing on the case studies presented in the research works. Indeed we found that 99% of the selected research works explicitly refer to a modeling view. Among the research papers selected, only one, by Sperner et al. [104] was classified neither as Process of Things nor as Things-aware Process, since it did not provide a modeling example. Table 4 sum- marizes the results. In the following, we present two examples of PoT and TaP. Process of Things refers to using business process modeling notations to design the internal behaviors of involved IoT devices and their orchestration. Figure 3 reports an example concerning the management of the devices integrated into a ventilation system [105]. The process starts with a message with the room number, the reservation period, and the maximum desired value of CO2. Then, when the meeting starts, the process con- tinuously requests the updated value of the CO 2. De- pending on the CO 2 value, the ventilation is adjusted. When the meeting finishes, the process execution is in- terrupted. Things-aware Process refers to the modeling of stan- dard business processes integrating smart devices into the system, resulting in complementary components within the execution of the entire process. Figure 4 shows an example of TaP [117]. The process describes the operation of the ordering of the eyeglass frame. The user sends his location, and based on age and gen- der, the shopping system generates recommendations for buying a frame. Finally, augmented reality allows the user to try the frame. 5.3 IoT requirements supported by the modeling notations used to model IoT-Aware business processes (RQ2) The research question RQ2 wants to clarify the IoT requirements supported by the modeling notations used to model IoT-Aware business processes. We found that Type of view Source # of research works (%) PoT [13, 15, 18, 19, 23, 45, 47, 63, 70, 95, 96, 97, 100, 101, 105, 109, 121] 17 (20%) TaP [2, 3, 6, 8, 14, 16, 20, 21, 22, 24, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 42, 43, 48, 49, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 62, 65, 66, 67, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 88, 89, 90, 91, 93, 94, 98, 99, 102, 103, 106, 107, 111, 112, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120] 66 (80%) Table 4: Papers distribution by IoT-Aware modeling views (RQ1) 100% of the selected research works refer to at least one requirement. Table 5 indicates the source of these works and shows the number of selected works that meet or partially meet the requirements. Those notations that support the R1. Entity Based Conceptrequirement do so by offering the pos- sibility to represent real-world objects of the Internet of Things, such as sensors, actuators, cloud systems, and environment in the design of the IoT-Aware model. Some notations partially cover this requirement, as they do not provide a direct modeling construct to the object [45, 78, 106, 107, 112]. The R2. Distributed Executionrequirement is satisfied when the modeling approaches allow the exe- cution to be distributed over many devices. For exam- ple, Suri et al. [106, 107] propose a framework for dis- tributing process execution across resource availability. The R3. Interactions requirement refers to the possibility of defining the link, in the design phase, of the physical entities with the other constructs of the model. The IoT-A notation [83], for example, enriches this interaction through the addition of attributes re- lated to how and which devices communicate or are connected with other entities in the model. 10 Ivan Compagnucci1 et al. Fig. 3: An example of PoT Modeling from Sungur et al. [105] The R4. Distributed Data requirement is met if the notation provides the possibility to define a data source derived from physical entities. For example, Meyer et al. [83] implement a smart data object, refer- ring to the device from which the data are extracted. A notation meets the R5. Scalabilityrequirement if it can provide information about the physical entities modeled during the design phase of the process. For example, the approaches based on BPEL [37, 49, 63] use information to assess the system\u2019s scalability from entities, resources, and services involved in the process. All the approaches met the R6. Abstraction re- quirement because the reported modeling notations can abstract activities to a higher level. To meet the R7. Availability - Mobilityrequire- ment, a modeling notation has to provide the capability to indicate if a device is available for a desired activ- ity or service. A device can be unavailable due to its mobility at execution time. Meyer et al. [83] permit to model the mobility aspect to address this problem. This marker can categorize a pool or a lane as a mobile pro- cess. Another example is given from the notation of [23], which introduces the location-based event for triggering actions based on the position of an entity. The R8. Fault Tolerancerequirement is met if the modeling notation can support failures that can happen in the IoT system. At the moment, all the selected ap- proaches discussing this requirement partially satisfy it since the resulting notation gives the possibility to rep- resent the fault, generally missing the motivations and its effect. The R9. Flexibility - Event basedrequirement is met if the notations allow dynamically changing the execution flow. Handling the typical event-driven de- cisions of IoT systems during run time is a complex challenge for business processes. Suri et al. [106, 107] introduce the Configurable Process Model (CPM) ap- proach to facilitate flexibility and reuse by sharing a set of process variants. The R10. Uncertainty of informationrequire- ment is met if the notation can define whether the data source of a device is accurate. In the first version of IAPM [84], the usage of an indicator, based on a per- centage scale, permitted to define the degree of cer- tainty of the information coming from a specific device. The R11. Real-Time requirement is met in all of the considered modeling notations since all the re- trieved approaches can model the real-time restrictions and constraints of IoT systems. 5.4 Modeling notations proposed and/or adopted to model IoT-Aware business processes (RQ3) The research question RQ3 wants to clarify what mod- eling notations are proposed and/or adopted to model IoT-Aware business processes. Table 6 summarize the results. Not-BPMN. This category groups all modeling approaches that do not use the BPMN standard as a core notation. Serral et al. [101] propose Context-Adaptive Petri- Net (CAPN), a formalism to construct Petri-Nets that are context-adaptive in smart environments. Song et al. [103] use CAPN for acquiring IoT-Awareness in an industrial application. Also, Zhang et al. [121] ap- plied a Petri-Net-based modeling approach, including information about the ubiquitous environment through context-aware information. Domingos et al. [36] extend the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) to include context vari- ables regarding IoT devices\u2019 information to establish communication between process instances and sensors. Kim et al. [63] propose BPEL to cover the technical problems in IoT computing regarding the management of the technical implementation of smart devices like the protocol supported, interface language, data ex- change scheme, and type of mobility provided.

BPMN 2.0.This category refers to all the research works that perceive BPMN as adequate in capturing process specifications of IoT scenarios; they represent IoT aspects using the standard BPMN elements. Caraca\u00b8 s and Bernauer [14] and Caraca\u00b8 s and Kramp [15] suggest an approach to model wireless sensor net- works using standard BPMN to close the gap between the specification of the devices and the actual imple- mentation of business processes.

A Systematic Literature Review on IoT-Aware Business Process Modeling Views, Requirements and Notations 13 Domingos and Martins [34, 74] propose a restricted set of BPMN elements for the design of smart scenar- ios. A scenario is modeled with standard BPMN, and then the diagram is transformed with recognition pat- tern techniques into executable code. Mass et al. [77] use BPMN as a starting point to model IoT scenarios managed by BPM Systems, proposing an architecture for decentralized device-to-device business process exe- cution over mobile nodes. Friedow et al. [47] present a contribution that allows coordinating the devices used in an IoT application using a business process engine with the design of BPMN models for the processing logic. Meroni et al. [80] focus on monitoring the compli- ance of the execution of multi-party business processes. They exploit the IoT paradigm by instructing smart ob- jects. The scenario is modeled in BPMN, translated into a set of artifact-centric process models, and rendered in another notation called Extended-GSM. Sch\u00a8 onig et al. [96] introduce an integrated architecture approach for IoT-Aware business process execution that exploits IoT for BPM, focusing on managing IoT data. The idea is to connect smart devices to the BPMS to keep track of the data coming from the devices and then consider them. Panfilenko et al.

[37] and Martins et al. [75] pro- pose to model IoT scenarios with BPMN by applying a decomposition approach to identify IoT operations that usually are performed in smart environments and then reproduce them in the modeling phase. The first work tries to generalize the patterns used to identify the part of BPMN processes that IoT devices can ex- ecute, respecting, at the same time, the original flow dependencies. In the second work, from a business pro- cess model, the decomposition approach is applied to assign the operations that should be performed to IoT devices. Kozma et al. [66] propose Arrowhead, a framework that supports automated manufacturing processes for Industry 4.0 to provide an easy-to-use model in stan- dard BPMN that leads the implementation of produc- tion goals.

[76] propose a decentralization of the IoT-Aware process to reduce the exchange of messages between central systems and IoT devices to reduce bat- tery consumption and device resources. Bocciarelli et al. [8] suggest an approach to support business processes that integrates IoT technology in Cyber-Physical Pro- duction Systems (CPPS) or smart factories. The goal is to enable a simulation-based analysis of the smart en- vironment regarding adaptability and reliability. Cheng et al. [19] model a smart scenario in BPMN standard communicating with a fog environment composed of smart devices for measuring essential vital signs of the patient. Caracas [13] proposes a mechanism for mapping the business process of a wireless sensor network into an event-based code for the management of the devices. Mandal et al. [70] emphasize the necessity to integrate within the business process external events that occur in the process context of the IoT technology. The gap between the conceptual process model, and its imple- mentation, needs to be bridged to perform this inte- gration properly. To this aim, a framework is proposed that handles smart system events to which the process subscribes. Elhami et al. [39] propose a context-aware 14 Ivan Compagnucci1 et al.

In particular, contextual events and data are integrated at run time using BPMS capabilities. In addition, this approach involves using deep neural net- works to forecast business process activities. BPMN Extensions.In this category are reported all the research works presenting extensions to the BPMN notation for better representing IoT aspects in a designed model. These research works have been ad- ditionally grouped based on the type of extension they apply: Meta-Model Only, Graphical Only, Meta-Model and Graphical. Table 7 summarize the results. The research works that only extend the stan- dard meta-model of BPMN with new attributes are [8, 38, 43] and [48]. The first work, by Ferreira et al. [43], defines a set of process constraints that must be respected during the execution. This mechanism is managed by the concept of process invariants and en- sures more dynamism in IoT-Aware business processes. The second work, by Bocciarelli et al. [8], introduces a BPMN meta-model extension for managing the re- sources of the smart devices modeled in the business process. This notation aims to provide low-level infor- mation (e.g., performance, reliability, resources) about the devices within the business process during the mod- eling phase. Dorndorfer and Seel [38] propose SenSo- Mod, a domain-specific modeling language for IoT. This approach acts as a dedicated language for the data ag- gregation from sensors to the business process. The au- thors propose an extension of the BPMN meta-model to provide the possibility to interact and obtain data from smart devices through the SenSoMod context model. Gao et al. [48] propose a novel approach for integrating the sensor/smart device layer with the business process. This approach adopts a Semantic Sensor Network on- tology with business processes to integrate sensor data at the process layer. For what concerns the research works that only ex- tend the graphical notation and those that extend both meta-model and graphical notation, we describe the modeling approaches by grouping them by type of no- tation element and new graphic constructs introduced. Table 8 and Table 9 offer a graphical overview of all added modeling constructs. We grouped the selected works by notation name and reported them, in chrono- logical order, to see how the proposed extended nota- tions have changed over time. The graphical notation elements have been reported and grouped based on the original construct to which an extension is applied: Ac- tivity, Event, Data, Pool/Lane, Gateway and Group. Activity. Starting from the extensions applied to activity elements, the IAPM project [84] proposes an extension of the Normal Task to represent an activity of a smart device. This task has a different design and in- cludes two additional attributes: the grade of certainty of information from the device (from 0 to 100) and the availability/potential fault of the devices. In 2012, with the deliverable [83], Meyer et al. defined three new ac- tivities for the description of IoT scenarios: the sensing task for representing the sensing action of a device; the actuation task for representing the actuation of a de- vice; the location-based activity to relate an activity with the position in which it occurs. The uBPMN modeling notation proposed by Yousfi et al. [118], introduces four types of tasks: the sensor task for the sensing action of a device; the actuator task for the actuation of a device; the reader task for the smart reading of RFID, bar code or bio-metrics; the collector task for the collection of any piece of context aside from using sensors or smart readers. Each task includes an additional attribute that defines its type (e.g., the sensor task may be of type Accelerometer). In a subsequent version of the proposal [117], custom extensions of the tasks are added to each smart de- vice, increasing the level of detail. In addition to the collector, sensing, actuator, and reader task, tasks for capturing images and sounds have been added. The BPMN4CPS approach [52] also proposes a sen- sor and an actuator task. In addition, this notation of- fers the possibility to model three new types of tasks: the web service task for modeling web services, the em- bedded service task for executing code inside the de- vices, and the cloud service task to perform operations in the cloud. The BPMN-MDM [67] proposes the cus- tomization of tasks as described above in Yousfi et al. [118]. The oldest selected paper on this topic [104] had already introduced two types of extended tasks: the sensing task and the actuating task.

Cheng et al. [20] define only a task for the sensing. Sang et al. [94] propose a Security Task for representing security-related activities. Sch\u00a8 oning et al. [95] extend the normal task into a cyber task. This extended task allows representing an action derived from devices. The BPMN4WSN approach [16] introduces a new extended task with three extra elements: a special marker, the task to be performed from the device, and the location in which the task should be performed. Sungur et al. [105] propose an extension of the nor- mal task named \u201cwsn task\u201d. It models an action per- formed in a WSN process and includes five extra at- tributes: tWSNOperation to bind a WSN operation to a WSN Task; actionType to define a WSN operation as a sense (?) or an actuation (!); isCommandAction to define if the task represents a command action; tWS- NPerformer to define the resource who will perform the action; isEventDriven to define if the task represents an event-driven action. The SPU extension [2] proposes two tasks for man- aging a data stream processing of IoT scenarios. This extension adds two different tasks: the Event Stream Specification task for the management of the stream events and their parameters with an implicit condi- tional for stopping the data stream; the Event Stream Processing Task for the management of the stream events and their parameters with clear conditions for the data stream stops. Zareen et al. [120], instead, pro- pose a set of markers that customize standard BPMN objects to implement information system security fea- tures. In particular, for the activities, we have only two types of markers applicable to the tasks: \u201cGoals\u201d for the activity\u2019s mission and \u201cAccess Mechanism\u201d in order to define the access type to the activities and to increase process security. Also, Corallo et al. [29] implement a particular task for smart activities, which includes a set of customized and domain-based attributes to increase the level of detail. Neumann et al. [86] suggest a set of customized tasks is defined to meet medical needs: the equipment task; the auxiliaries task; the instrument task; the medicine task; the human resources task; the medical device task; the location task; the clinical IT system task and the consumption task. In [89] the IoT activities are repre- sented as service tasks extended with extra attributes. Mass et al. [78] introduce a particular task with ex- tra attributes extended from the normal task of BPMN standard in order to establish a communication between the business process and smart devices. Kim et al. [62] propose an extension of the normal task for the inter- action with Arduino for both sensing and actuation of the device. Ardito et al. [3] suggest a set of extended tasks for the management of IoT devices and for representing in- teractions with a chatbot. IoT entities are represented by: a sensor and actuator task, a task for the connection between the cloud and devices, and a streaming task for managing the IoT data stream. The interactions with a chatbot are represented by: the chat notification task for the chat receipt notification; the group and channel notification chat for the group or channel receipt noti- fication; the command task for the execution of specific bot commands; the inline task for REST communica- tions between the bot and external services. Event. We identified fewer approaches that extend BPMN events. Only in one work related to the IAPM notation [23], proposes the introduction of a location event. This event is triggered when something happens in a defined space, room, or location. In uBPMN, Yousfi et al. [117] propose a set of intermediate events corre- sponding to the extended tasks mentioned above. The events implemented are the sensor event for triggering a sensing action, the reader event for triggering a read- ing action, the image event for triggering the capture of an image, the audio event for triggering the capture of a sound, and the collector event for triggering the ac- quisition of information. In [65], Kozel proposes three types of event: the location-based event that can occur if the mobile participant reaches a pre-defined location; the position update event notifies an entity\u2019s change of position; the conditional positional event occurs if a mobile participant reaches a region in a predefined max- imum distance. These events are proposed as catching, throwing, starting, and ending types. Sang and Zhou [94] introduces four extended bound- ary events and three intermediate events. For the boundary set, we have the Authentication event that implements the authentication function of the busi- ness process model; the Access Control event for man- aging the permissions on the access to a particular place or resource from a group of authenticated users in the business process; the Authorization for already authenticated users, in order to perform further ac- tions; the Harm Protection which activates a protec- tion mechanism for the business process which offers functionalities similar to a firewall. For the intermediate events set, we have the Encrypted Message event, which aims to encrypt a business process message; the Non- Repudiation event for the agreement of the interactions between two different entities; the Secure Communica- tion event to certify that the communication between two entities is secure. Data. Similar solutions have been presented for data elements in the identified different modeling ap- proaches. In the deliverable of the IAPM project [83], 18 Ivan Compagnucci1 et al. the Data Object and the Data Store are extended with a marker to define that they contain real-world data derived from smart devices. uBPMN [118], extends the standard Data Object in new element named \u201cSmart Data Object\u201d. It consists of a specific data collection de- rived from sensors or smart readers. The Smart Object is introduced in a subsequent version of uBPMN [117]. It is an extended data object used to collect certain data from sensors, smart readers, microphones, or a camera. The BPMN-MDM approach [67] implements the same Smart Data Object already discussed by Yousfi et al. [118]. In SPU [2], where the concept of the data stream is introduced, the standard data object has been extended into the Input/Output event stream data object. This element can collect input or output smart device data streams. Zareen et al. [120] implement a set of specific markers for the data objects. We have Goals for the mission of the data object; the Threat for defining the possible problems and vulnerabilities in the security of the business process; the Data Object States for indi- cating different types of data objects; Access Mecha- nisms to define the access type and to increase process security. Pool/Lane. The extension regarding pool and lane elements focuses on the representation of smart devices. In the deliverable from Meyer et al. [83], the pool is marked with the location-based symbol to mark a pro- cess as \u201cmobile\u201d. A mobile process represents a process that can change the position in which it operates over time. In addition, the possibility of modeling a new par- ticipant representing a real-world physical entity called \u201cPhysical Entity\u201d is introduced. This element is not considered in the execution of the process, but it is used in the modeling phase to represent the interaction of the process with real-world entities. Petrasch and Hentschke [90] highlight pools with a symbol of a cloud containing the word \u201cIoT\u201d to indi- cate an IoT device process. It is used as a smile marker to indicate whether there is human intervention in the pool or lane. Petrasch and Hentschke [91] propose a marker with a cloud to indicate that the pool models the operation of a cloud communicating with a smart scenario. This marker can contain the wordpub to indi- cate public clouds, priv to indicate private clouds, and hybrid to indicate hybrid clouds. Suri et al. [107] allow the possibility to specify the resources of sensors, actuators, and tag devices (RFID) with the addition of specific markers while modeling a pool. These markers are defined as \u201cIoT Resource Def- initions\u201d and include attributes such as accuracy or re- sponse time; their values are considered during the pro- cess flow execution. Graja et al. [52] introduce the Phys- ical Entity concept for a participant pool marked with the symbol of the world. Sperner et al. [104] introduce the physical entity as a participant in an IoT-Aware process for the first time. In this case, no additional marker is provided in the pool, and it is also suggested that a physical entity pool can be multi-instance. Ramos-Merino et al. [79] introduce two markers in the pool for adding extra conditions that should be re- spected in the execution of the process. Sang et al. [94] propose a pool or lane marked with a symbol that de- fines its degree of Integrity, Confidentiality, and Avail- ability of the process. Each of these characteristics can take on a value from 1 to 3, which is indicated by the number of stars represented by the marker. Sungur et al. [105] assign a mark to pools or lanes that model a behavior expressed by an IoT device. Zareen et al. [120] implement the same markers already mentioned in the Data extensions. Gateway. Referring to gateway extensions, only Suri et al.[107] propose customization of the gateways to route the IoT-Aware process execution according to the available resources of the devices or the IoT system. They represent three operators: Configurable IoT As- signment operator, Configurable IoT Replication opera- tor, and Configurable IoT Shareability operator, which can be assigned to gateways. Group. An extension regarding group elements is proposed by Grefen et al. [54] that introduce the con- cept of geographic co-location to specify where activ- ities are performed in IoT-Aware business processes. Tasks are grouped by a dotted set that specifies the location and the maximum radius in which they can be performed. It is also possible to define an exception handler for notifying alarms and restarting critical ac- tivities. Most of the approaches do not provide the possibil- ity to be used for several reasons: from the deprecation of the tool that implements the notation to the unavail- ability of the site reported as a reference for the pro- posed extension. In particular, approaches that adopt BPMN standard can be replicated, while concerning extended notations, we only have access to the solu- tion in a few cases. The available extensions are: IoT- BPO [106, 107], IAPM [82], STEP-ONE [78]. However, many research works that refer to the same notation can present a different maturity of the proposed ap- proach. Generally, the first research works on a notation propose the approach from a theoretical point of view and then move on to the implementation in subsequent works. Table 10 intends to clarify this distinction.

Each analyzed paper refers to one application domain, except for a paper by Hasic et al. [56] that refers to three application domains. Table 11 summarizes the results. Regarding the distribution of application domains in which the selected relevant approaches are engaged, we notice an evident prevalence of three domains: In- dustrial, Commercial, and Smart City. Table 12 high- lights the various domains subject to these IoT-Aware business process modeling activities over the years. The number has been increasing, probably due to the in- creasingly widespread of IoT technologies. We report details on the specific case study discussed in each re- search work in the following.

Table 13 groups the research works based on the tool support they provide for modeling IoT-Aware business processes while Table 14 lists such tools. Tool Maturity Source # of research works (%) Mature Tool [14, 15, 20, 21, 42, 45, 66, 78, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 106, 107] 16 (19%) Early Proto- type [3, 16, 22, 32, 34, 36, 38, 47, 62, 76, 79, 82, 85, 88, 89, 90, 91, 93, 94, 102, 105, 109, 111, 112] 24 (29%) No Provided Tool [2, 6, 8, 13, 18, 19, 23, 24, 29, 33, 35, 37, 39, 43, 48, 49, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 63, 65, 67, 70, 73, 74, 75, 77, 80, 81, 83, 84, 86, 95, 103, 104, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121] 44 (52%) Table 13: Papers distribution by tools availability (RQ3.2) Tool Source Activiti [62, 66, 89, 94] ARIS [79] Bonita [42] BPEL Designer Project [36] bpmn-js [3, 47] Camunda [88, 96, 97] CoTaSe [45] CPN Tools [101] Eclipse BPMN2 [21, 22, 76, 109] Eclipse Modeling Framework [98, 99, 100] Flowable [78] jBPM [20, 32, 34] MagicDraw [90, 91] Metasonic Build [112] Oryx [14, 15] Signavio [82, 93, 102] Signavio Core Component [16, 85, 105, 106, 107, 111] Table 14: Tools for modeling IoT-Aware business pro- cesses For presentation purposes, we reported in Figure 5 the extracted tools, including the year and the number of times they have been used in the selected works. The tools have been arranged so that we can see the tools that appeared first by looking at the figure clockwise and from the inside to the outside. Oryx was the first tool in the identified literature (2011), while Flowable was the last (2020). The total number of appearances from 2011 to 2020 is reported in brackets under the tool\u2019s name (e.g., Oryx appeared twice in total, while Activiti appeared five times). We deepened the investigation of the tools that emerged by extracting some general information from the tools\u2019 websites or their primary research papers; we collected them in Table 1510. This information may not necessarily regard the modeling of IoT-Aware BPs, however they can serve as indicators to help researchers in the choice of a modeling tool suitable for their needs. All the modeling tools, but Oryx and Signavio Core Component, which are now deprecated, are available online. As can be seen from the Last Release column, 10 Note, this list is not meant to be exhaustive, but it rep- resents only the tools that emerged from the research works we identified as a result of the literature review process. 22 Ivan Compagnucci1 et al. 2012 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2011 2014 2013 2 6 Fig. 5: Tools usage for modeling IoT-Aware business processes during years several of such modeling tools are not updated anymore (i.e., Oryx, Signavio Core component, and BPEL De- signer Project), while some tools have not been updated for a couple of years (i.e., CPN Tools, CoTaSe, ARIS, and MetaSonic Build). The remaining tools (i.e., Activ- iti, MagicDraw, Eclipse Modeling Framework, jBPM, Camunda, Eclipse BPMN2 Modeler, Bonita, bpmn-js, Signavio, Flowable) have been updated at least once in the last year. The identified tools also differ for the associated Li- cense. Some of them are proprietary (i.e., MetaSonic Build and Signavio) while others have less restrictive or open licenses. Tools with open licenses can be mod- ified or extended to better fit users\u2019 needs. With the term Extensibility, in Table 15, we refer to whether the tool allows adding new notation elements to the provided standard ones. Some tools (e.g., Activ- iti, Flowable, jBPM) offer the possibility to add graph- ical elements in the modeling palette supported by a custom class already extended and validated by default on the meta-model. This class provides an interface for integrating new attributes, icons, and behavior in the design phase. Other tools (e.g., Camunda, ARIS) do not provide direct support for extending modeling con- structs. The engine must be extended to add new cus- tom modeling constructs, and the desired features must be manually integrated. The BPEL Designer Project eclipse plugins offer the possibility to extend the WS- BPEL 2.0 specifications by adding new features and at- tributes in a dedicated extensions section. The Eclipse Modeling Framework allows extending existing models via inheritance. The framework defines a base model and provides the possibility to define an extension based on it. In MagicDraw, extending the standard BPMN meta-model at the formal level is possible by modifying the UML classes for BPMN. Some tools (e.g., Signavio and Bonita) provide API for extending the BPM engine and adding features. By extending the MyBaseClass it is possible to add methods and attributes through in- heritance in Java. However, some tools (e.g., MetaSonic Build, CoTaSe, CPN Tools) are not extended because they are used with as-is approaches. 5.7 Notation used to support the enactment of IoT-Aware business processes (RQ3.3) The research question RQ3.3 wants to clarify the nota- tion used to enact IoT-Aware business processes. Table 16 summarize the results. Some of those works make usage of BPMN only for the design of business process models. Others propose entire architectures and frame- works based on BPMN and related tools to enable the execution phase. It is important to state that the ap- proaches that implement the enactment of business pro- cesses are required to design their models previously. For what concerns the approaches using BPMN for de- sign, we refer to Section 5.4, where we have already ex- tensively discussed them. Therefore, in the rest of this section, we only focus on the approaches used for the execution phase. Serral et al. [101] propose a context-adaptive Petri- net model to accurately design and enact the behavior of their dynamic systems integrating IoT technologies. Doing so can be taken more informed decisions, and better use of resources increases competitiveness. Seiger et al. [98, 99, 100] adopt the MAPE-K feedback loop to monitor and enact the IoT-Aware business process and to correlate sensing data to the process execution. The model extensions and execution components for the MAPE-K loop are then applied to a process nota- tion and engine, resulting in a generic framework for self-adaptive real-world processes. Martins and Domin- gos [34, 74] directly focus on IoT and business processes, proposing first to use BPMN to model IoT scenarios, then to transform the models into an intermediate lan- guage, such as Callas Byte Code, to describe WSN sys- tems, and finally to execute such code on the IoT de- vices. Domingos et al. [36] propose an executable exten- sion of BPEL, which defines a set of context variables for handling sensor values. Caraca\u00b8 s and Bernauer [14], Caraca\u00b8 s and Kramp [15] and Caraca\u00b8 s [13] use BPMN to capture IoT scenar- ios and transform such models into code to be exe- cuted. In particular, the transformation of the model into executable code is performed with patterns to code A Systematic Literature Review on IoT-Aware Business Process Modeling Views, Requirements and Notations 23 Tool First Release Last Release License Extensibility Activiti 2010 2019 Apache License 2.0 \u2713 ARIS 2009 2017 Freeware \u2713 Bonita 2009 2020 GNU \u2713 BPEL Designer Project 2005 2015 Eclipse Public License \u2713 bpmn-js 2015 2020 bpmn.io \u2713 Camunda 2013 2020 Apache License 2.0 \u2713 CoTaSe 2017 2018 Freeware \u2717 CPN Tools 2000 2018 GNU GPL2 \u2717 Eclipse BPMN2 Modeler 2015 2020 Eclipse Public License \u2713 Eclipse Modeling Framework 2004 2019 Eclipse Public License \u2713 Flowable 2016 2020 Apache License 2.0 \u2713 jBPM 2016 2020 Open Source \u2713 MagicDraw 2011 2020 Trialware \u2713 MetaSonic Build 2012 2018 Proprietary \u2717 Oryx 2009 2009 Open Source \u2717 Signavio 2009 2020 Proprietary \u2713 Signavio Core Component 2009 2011 Open Source \u2717 Table 15: List of identified tools and their characteristics techniques. Dar et al. [32] propose an integration be- tween IoT technologies and BPM using a REST archi- tecture that allows bilateral communication to support the business process execution. Mass et al. [77] propose a system architecture for the decentralization of the ex- ecution of IoT-Aware business processes. The idea is to distribute the execution of the processes to multi- ple parties and into different nodes. Friedow et al. [47] integrate the IoT concepts into business processes via cloud services. For each device is defined a code for the communication with the process via REST API calls using the cloud as an intermediary. Meroni et al. [80] focus on the communication and coordination among multiple BPMSs between impera- tive languages, used to model the process quickly, and declarative languages used to configure the monitor- ing of an IoT system. Cimino et al. [24] propose an approach to evaluate the effectiveness of smart tech- nologies by enacting and monitoring a BPMN business process in a real-world scenario. Hou et al. [58] propose an approach to execute IoT-Aware business processes in a distributed way due to the high degree of mobil- ity of devices strictly linked to their geo-location. The process is split thanks to the location-based fragmen- tation algorithm, and each part of the starting process can collaborate to complete a common goal. D\u2019Hondt et al. [33] containerize micro-services are modeled and executed in BPMN language to enable distributed an- alytics on the IoT edge. Domingos et al. [35] design a scenario with BPMN and then translate the output model into executable code that is running on the physical devices to opti- mize the overall WSN communication and computa- tional capability usage of devices. Cheng et al. [19, 21] propose a service-based fog execution environment to fit the dynamic smart scenario with an IoT-Aware busi- ness process. Sch\u00a8 onig et al. [96, 97] propose the integra- tion of an IoT data provenance framework so that data from smart devices can be considered when executing an IoT-Aware business process. In addition, based on the sensing of this data and in the occurrence of certain conditions, it can dynamically trigger the execution of parallel processes. Panfilenko et al. [88] propose the BPMN standard for designing and executing an industrial CPS system to achieve real-time knowledge of the system\u2019s anomalies. Ruiz et al. [42] propose an architecture that includes, on the one hand, the execution of a business process in the BPMN standard and, on the other hand, the man- agement of wearable sensors to monitor the condition of a patient. All this information from sensors guides the business process flow in making real-time decisions based on data. Teixeira et al. [109] implement LAURA, a conceptual architecture that provides the possibility to enact a business process supported by a rule layer for the management of real-time events in the IoT world. Kozma et al. [66] propose using standard BPMN and CPN-based production-level descriptions to define the IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) entities involved in the process. Goncalves et al. [50] propose an approach composed of IoT, CEP, and the enactment of declara- tive business process technologies for the management of IoT-Aware business processes. Mass et al. [78] enact an IoT-Aware business pro- cess to capture metrics and performance and to manage edge and fog computing situations of the IoT network. Martins et al. [76] aim to decentralize the execution of IoT-Aware business processes by moving them directly 24 Ivan Compagnucci1 et al. into the IoT devices, using their computational capabil- ities. This process\u2019s decentralization is done through a decomposition technique of the main process. Mandal et al. [70] propose a mechanism to integrate external events, such as web services or IoT device interactions, within the execution of a business process. Tranquillini et al. [111], Sungur et al. [105], and Mottola et al. [85] propose a layered approach for developing, deploying, and managing WSNs that interact with information systems. SPU [2] models an abstraction of the event stream processing, which generally represents a data stream produced from smart sensors. The approach integrates new concepts that manage data flow from devices dur- ing process execution. Park et al. [89] extend a standard BPMN workflow engine to implement the management of smart services by sensing data directly from smart devices and analyzing it in the process execution. Kim et al. [62] focus on executing IoT-Aware processes ca- pable of integrating ARDUINO\u2019s functionalities. Suri et al. [106, 107] propose an executable semantic frame- work to bridge the gap between IoT resources and busi- ness process management. After a formal description of the IoT resources, they were considered at the process modeling and execution phases. Elhami et al. [39] propose a mechanism for the inte- gration of IoT contextual information in run-time pro- cess prediction. The idea is to design a predictive IoT- Aware business process starting from contextual events collected in the environment. Ardito et al. [3] develop a telegram bot by enacting an extended business process that can monitor the interactions between IoT devices and telegram commands typed by the users. Dorndor- fer and Seel [38] introduce a domain-specific modeling language for modeling the contextual environment by extracting data from sensors. Then the context model generated is used to aggregate device data and make them available to model the IoT-Aware business pro- cess. 6 Discussion This section discusses the need for a process-oriented modeling notation integrating IoT-related aspects. We compared relevant approaches found in the literature with the requirements identified within the European project called IoT-A [83], a reference point for this topic. In addition, the data extracted from the re- search questions are compared to determine possible correlations between the use of notations, the model- ing views, the application domains, and the modeling requirements of IoT-Aware processes.

Finally, threats to validity are pre- sented. 6.1 On the need for an IoT-Aware business process modeling notation From the analysis of the papers in this SLR, and as also motivated by Beverungen et al. [7], there is a clear need to enrich modeling languages with ad- ditional constructsto grasp aspects and characteris- tics of the IoT world, that influence business processes modeling. IoT\u2019s physical and tangible nature has to be reconducted into an abstract graphical representation. Current research usually extends the standard meta- model, typically the BPMN meta-model, which defines the nature of such graphical representation. This is cru- cial to ensure compatibility between modeling editors and workflow engines. A standardization effort involv- ing the OMG organization, that maintains the BPMN notation [87], would be much beneficial in deriving stan- dard notation elements for modeling IoT-aware busi- ness processes. OMG could activate a dedicated work- ing group that could extend the existing BPMN stan- dard, to incorporate IoT dedicated attributes and ele- ments. This could be much beneficial for consolidating a standard notation that could foster support and porta- bility for IoT-aware business process models among dif- ferent tools. However, extending a notation with addi- tional constructs can affect its complexity; the more constructs are present, the more complex a notation is perceived by its users. Furthermore, given the advantages of the model- driven development paradigm, it is crucial to pay spe- A Systematic Literature Review on IoT-Aware Business Process Modeling Views, Requirements and Notations 25 Source Notation R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 R9 R10 R11 Non BPMN 2.0 Standard Notation [101, 103] Context-Adaptive PN \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2248 \u2248 \u2713 \u2713 [121] Context-Aware PN \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 \u2713 [45] CoTaL \u2248 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 \u2713 [112] S-BPM \u2248 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 [98, 99] Abstract State Machine \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [100] Domain Specific Language \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [36, 49, 63] BPEL \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 [6] GSM Workflow \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 BPMN 2.0 Standard Notation [8, 13, 14, 15, 19, 21, 22, 24, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 39, 42, 43, 47, 50, 56, 58, 66, 70, 74, 75, 76, 77, 80, 88, 96, 102, 109, 115] BPMN 2.0 \u2248 \u2248 \u2248 \u2248 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 \u2713 BPMN 2.0 IoT-Aware Extensions [18, 23, 73, 81, 82, 83, 84, 90, 93] IAPM \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 [91] I4PML \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [106, 107] IoT-BPO \u2248 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [116, 117, 118, 119] uBPMN \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [52] BPMN4CPS \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [67] BPMN-MDM \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [104] Sperner et al. \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [79] BPMN-E2 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [48] Gao et al. \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [20] Cheng et al. \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [65] Kozel T. \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [94] Sang et al. \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2248 \u2713 [95, 97] Sch\u00a8 onig et al. \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 [54] Grefen et al. \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [16, 85, 105, 111] BPMN4WSN \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [2] SPU \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [120] Zareen et al. \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 \u2713 [29] Corallo et al. \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 [86] BPMNSIX \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 [89] Park et al. \u2713 \u2248 \u2248 \u2713 \u2713 [78] STEP-ONE \u2248 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 [62] Kim et al. \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2248 \u2713 [3] BPMN-X \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 Table 17: Notations comparison based on IoT-A requirements (Fully satisfied: \u2713; Partly satisfied: \u2248) cial attention to modeling aspects impacting the de- velopment of complex smart systems. Thus, the need to enrich the modeling notation with concepts from the IoT world impacting the development is highlighted. Research works on context-aware applications [55, 82] state that IoT technologies sensing and actuat- ing the environmental contextdirectly affect the link between the execution of a process and the phys- ical environment in which it is enacted. While, on the one hand, modeling these technologies allows context awareness, on the other hand, it reduces the abstraction level of the business process model. Even if IoT envi- ronments operate at a low abstraction level depending on the device\u2019s nature, business processes should guar- antee separation of concern, avoiding introducing low- level aspects. PoT and TaP types of views should guide the model abstraction since they are used to define re- spectively the internal behavior of devices or the system in which they operate. Another important aspect to consider in modeling IoT devices refers to the possibility to express information regarding their physical resources (e.g., the battery level, the available processing power, or the sampling rate). Being able to model such quanti- tative aspects also allows to reason in advance on device resources, optimally manage them to avoid errors, and provide fault tolerance in critical tasks at run time [73]. The available graphical notations do not directly sup- port quantitative aspects related to the use of physical 26 Ivan Compagnucci1 et al. resources. In most cases, meta-model extensions are ap- plied to add attributes to already available elements, or textual annotations are used to report that quantitative information. This is especially valid in cases where mod- els guide the performance analysis of the represented systems [29]. 6.2 Notation comparison Different notations related to different approaches sup- port similar IoT concepts. The most common concepts related to the IoT world that are represented in those notations are: physical entities, sensors, actuators, and the surrounding environment. Given the data and the event-driven nature of IoT systems, it is necessary to consider these data and events while modeling such scenarios. BPMN provides several constructs [28], es- pecially it already provides a set of data objects and events, that have been extended by the analyzed ap- proaches to integrate IoT aspects. Some notations also add the possibility to represent a concept of mobility of the device, by using markers to indicate that the behav- ior of a device can change its position. The specification of this kind of information prevents critical errors that could occur during the execution. By analyzing the various contributions in the lit- erature, we noticed that many research works con- sider multiple IoT requirements of the European IoT- A Project [83] (details have been already provided in Section 5.3). In Table 17 we report an overview of the requirements supported by the different modeling no- tations extracted from the literature. Notice that we grouped research works referring to the same notation, leading to the identification of 17 different approaches. In addition, we have defined a score related to the cov- erage of the requirements by the modeling notations. In doing this, we weighted the coverage distinguish- ing if the requirement is fully fulfilled (one point), only partially fulfilled (half a point), or not fulfilled (zero points). The final score is calculated in percentage con- sidering the total points obtained from all the eleven requirements. Figure 6 shows the scores obtained by the various notations. It is worth noticing that most approaches have a score under 50%. In particular, the average score of the modeling notations is about 46%. This certainly highlights the overall difficulty of the approaches in modeling smart environments in a fully process-oriented way. The notation that achieved the highest score is IAPM that satisfied 86% of the listed requirements. IAPM results from a project funded by the Euro- pean Union [83], and it is described in several research works discussing the different details of the notation [18, 23, 73, 81, 82, 84, 90, 93]. The IAPM approach is considered the pioneer in this field. Many of the field\u2019s research work is based on assumptions and in- sights. The first requirement referring to entity-based concepts (R1), is satisfied by adhering to the IoT Do- main Model defined by Meyer et al. [83] which covers all the entity-related concepts of the IoT domain (e.g., Physical Entity, Devices, Resources). The distributed execution requirement ( R2) is satisfied by modeling the IoT activities in a specific pool dedicated to IoT devices. These pools are identified by a special marker indicating that a pool represents the process of a spe- cific device. The interaction requirement (R3) is met by introducing two additional forms of interactions. First, the device interacts with Physical Entities. Second, the services known by enterprise systems processes inter- act with the software components of devices [83]. The distributed data requirement ( R4) is provided by ex- tending the data object and data store of BPMN with the real-word data object. The scalability requirement (R5) is partly satisfied due to the ability to specify addi- tional parameters, which, however, have no direct effect on the real IoT system\u2019s scalability. Finally, the avail- ability/mobility requirement (R7) is introduced with a special marker for mobile processes and pools to express the mobile nature of IoT devices. The Fault Tolerance requirement (R8) is partly met because it is provided only the possibility to express a percentage value that defines the fault tolerance rate on each IoT-related ac- tivity. The Flexibility/Event-based requirement ( R9) is met by the introduction of specific events that can trigger actions depending on the position. The Uncer- tainty of information requirement ( R10) is partly met due to the impossibility of verifying the correctness of the information derived by IoT devices. However, such information can be accessed by a manual inspection. Finally, Abstraction (R6) and Real-Time (R11) are re- quirements that are met in all of the considered model- ing notations. Concerning the Real-Time requirement, we recall that it refers to the suitability to express time constraints based on which IoT-aware business process activities have to occur (Section 4.2); all the scouted notations are equipped with time-based modeling ele- ments that support it. Given all the research works focusing on the IAPM notation and all the IoT requirements it supports, we could consider it a reference notation. However, IAPM does not support some requirements, i.e., R5 - Scal- ability, R8 - Fault Tolerance, and R10 - Uncertainty of information. Support for requirements R5 and R10 can be retrieved from other approaches. The former re- quirement is supported by Song et al. [103] who propose an approach that allows representing information about A Systematic Literature Review on IoT-Aware Business Process Modeling Views, Requirements and Notations 27 the entities involved in the system. The latter, instead, is supported by Zareen et al. [120] who provide an ap- proach that can represent security mechanisms to allow safe communication between authorized and certified parties involved in the IoT-aware business process. 6.3 Relationships among notation usage, applications domains, modeling views, and notation requirements To better understand the relationships of the IoT-aware modeling approaches, we analyze the adopted modeling views, the IoT requirements, the considered application domains, and the notation usage by putting together results from research questions RQ1, RQ2, RQ3.1, and RQ3.3. The findings related to the modeling environ- ment on the tool resulting from RQ3.2 are not consid- ered here since they mainly constitute a technical con- tribution, not relevant for this cross-cutting analysis. We first consider the interplay between PoT and TaP types of views and the life-cycle phases of IoT sys- tems to which the proposed notation refers. Figure 7 highlights such relations. Among the works discussing Design Only, we found that 37 works (86%) model the scenario with a TaP view, whereas the remaining six works (14%) adopt the PoT view. Regarding the nota- tions that support the Enactment/Execution phase of the IoT-aware systems, we found that 30 works (73%) model the scenario with a TaP view, and 11 works (27%) model the scenario with a PoT view. The re- sults\u2019 analysis shows no correlations between modeling views and the life-cycle phases can be highlighted. We then concentrate our study on the implications given by the application domains. In Figure 8 we report the interplay between PoT and TaP types of views and the application domains. TaP is mainly used for mod- eling Commercial, Industrial, and Smart City domains, while PoT appears to be primarily related to Smart City. However, it is worth noticing that, independently from the view, the smart city domain seems to be the most attractive scenario for modeling approaches pro- viding internal behavior of IoT devices and their coop- eration, as well as a more comprehensive view of inte- grating IoT devices into the work system. In Figure 9 we also report the interplay between the application domains and the business process life-cycle phases to which the proposed notation refers. Overall, the notations that support only the design phase and those that support also the enactment evenly consider the application domains with slight differences for In- dustrial and Commercial domains that are mainly con- sidered only from a design perspective. We also focus our study on the implications given by the IoT requirements. Figure 10 shows the number of works that satisfy (even partially) an IoT requirement concerning PoT and TaP views. Although the TaP view is adopted more often than the PoT one, we can observe that their graphs present similar shapes. Therefore, we can conclude that the requirements do not influence the modeling type of view. Figure 11, instead, highlights how Design Only and Enactment/Execution phases relate to the IoT model- ing requirements. The graph shows that modeling ap- proaches used for supporting the enactment generally meet fewer requirements than those for supporting the design. This is the case of R7 Availability - Mobility and R10 - Uncertainly of information, which are not met by any notation that supports the execution phase. More generally, the notations that support Design Only or Enactment/Execution phases fulfill requirements R1, R5, R6, R8, R9, and R11. Requirements R3, R4, R7, and R10 are satisfied only by approaches considering the Design Only phase, while only R2 is satisfied by notations supporting the Enactment/Execution phase. 6.4 Directions for future research Based on our collected results, we envision several di- rections for future research to bridge the gap between IoT and business processes. As discussed in the paper, much is done referring to the modeling of IoT-aware business processes as well as how the modeling affects all the other phases of the business process life cycle [114]. However, there is not a standard approach that can consider at the same time all the characteristics needed to support all the different phases. Indeed for each phase, we see space for contributions. We discuss possible directions for future research, considering one phase at a time. Process Modeling. Referring to the modeling of business processes enhanced with IoT concepts, we ex- tensively analyzed the literature through our investi- gation. As a result, we have shed light on the various proposals made over the years, discussing the lack of a standard way to model IoT-aware business processes. All the presented approaches, indeed, tackle the model- ing of IoT-aware business processes from different per- spectives, introducing specific graphical elements. The intervention of a well-recognized authority/group would be beneficial for defining a comprehensive and primar- ily used extension of BPMN for IoT. To start, graphi- cal elements to be included in such a standard could be taken from the available literature, focusing on those attracting more attention or that are used the most (e.g., sensing and actuation tasks and smart data ob- jects). However, a notation incorporating the best pro- posal from all the presented approaches is still missing. 28 Ivan Compagnucci1 et al.

Process Analysis. Business processes that inter- act with the IoT world by automatizing the sensing and performing actions (using actuator devices) de- mand special attention. Such processes can affect the environment, and in many cases, it is hard (if not impos- sible) to reverse the actions they perform. Thus, there is a need for techniques to analyze, simulate, and test PoT TaP General Healthcare Industrial Smart City Environmental Commercial Fig. 8: Modeling Views with respect to Application Do- mains such processes before actually executing them. Already available techniques and tools focusing on process anal- ysis (e.g., [30, 31, 59]), together with those referring to process simulation (e.g., [11, 46, 92]), could be adapted to handle the distinctive features of IoT-aware business processes. Process Implementation.Business process mod- els are often used as input in process engines that support companies in the organization and optimiza- A Systematic Literature Review on IoT-Aware Business Process Modeling Views, Requirements and Notations 29 Design Only Execution General Healthcare Industrial Commercial Smart City Environmental Fig. 9: Notation Usage concerning Application Domains PoT TaP R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6R7 R8 R9 R10 R11 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Fig. 10: Modeling Views with respect to Notation Re- quirements Design Only Execution R 1 R 2 R 3 R 4 R 5 R 6R 7 R 8 R 9 R 10 R 11 0 10 20 30 40 50 Fig. 11: Notation Usage concerning Notation Require- ments tion of their processes and the resources involved in such processes. To the best of our knowledge, no en- gine presents specific functionalities for implementing IoT-aware business processes. Using already available process engines can be a starting point for process im- plementation. On the one hand, this approach prevents anyone from \u2018re-inventing the wheel\u2019 regarding business process implementation. On the other hand, it requires some compromises since process engines usually handle process models designed with precise notations (e.g., BPMN, Petri Net, BPEL). However, these notations have some expressiveness limitations. In particular, if a notation does not provide support for IoT concepts such as sensors, actuators, real-time and event streams, those concepts must be handled by the process designer with some workaround to make it still possible to use the process engine as it is. From our study, it emerged that there is no standard way to let already available process engines handle IoT-aware business processes. A study on shared practices may be helpful. In addition, open-source process engines may be suitable for han- dling this limitation since they may allow for incorpo- rating previously unforeseen aspects (e.g., using exten- sions). Moreover, much work has been done to provide users with IoT platforms that can ease the configuration and the usage of IoT systems [40]. Also, IoT platforms may benefit from an integration that aims to bridge the gap between tool support for IoT and tool support for business process management. Process Monitoring. IoT systems can be de- ployed to keep track of business process activities. Therefore, enhancing the support for monitoring IoT- aware business processes could allow business analysts to keep the status of the monitored processes under control by leveraging the data retrieved by the IoT. For example, data can be reported and analyzed using dashboards, which are commonly used in IoT. The pos- sibility of actually seeing the retrieved data and putting it into the business process activity that is being per- formed may empower business analysts with the sup- port to spot erroneous or exceptional situations (e.g., an activity not being performed). This can enable pro- cess participants to perform near real-time corrective actions. In this respect, IoT data can also be used as a support for predicting which activity will be performed next or to predict the entire process result. Process Mining.In process mining, IoT data logs could be combined with activity logs to discover busi- ness processes based on historical data. This can enable retrospective analysis based on performance and detect process instances drifting from the specified behavior initially intended for the process. However, data pro- vided by IoT systems and process engines differ in size and production rate. IoT data can quickly degenerate in Big Data, so being characterized by the well-known di- mensions of volume, velocity, variety, and veracity [72]. Instead, data produced by process engines depends on: the number of process activities to be performed, their kind (e.g., manual vs. automatized), and the speed re- quired to perform them. How to handle these differences 30 Ivan Compagnucci1 et al. to make the best out of those data demands some re- search efforts. Especially, mapping IoT data to process activities is a research area that is under investigation [68]. 6.5 Threats to validity To assess the validity and to identify possible threats of the SLR, we follow the classification schema for sec- ondary studies defined by Ampatzoglou et al. [1]. It comprises three areas: study selection validity, data va- lidity, and research validity. The study selection validityaims to validate the procedure of harvesting and filtering relevant works [1]. The selection of the digital libraries and the construc- tion of the search string can strongly influence the re- sults and must be carefully planned. Differently from the previous version of this work [27] we reduced the number of digital libraries that we considered since, Web of Science and Scopus usually index articles from IEEE and ACM digital libraries. However, we cannot guarantee that this is valid for all the relevant works. Despite our effort in defining the most complete search query (Section 4) we cannot guarantee that the query allows us to find all the relevant research work. To mit- igate this threat, we added a snowballing step that al- lowed us to include research works that did not resulted from the performed query. Moreover, it is worth notic- ing that some potentially relevant research works re- leased after the time frame we consider may be missing. Another threat to validity comes from our defined set of selection criteria. In the studies, we do not refer to all business process life cycle phases, but we focus only on the modeling phase and in the context of a top-down ap- proach. However, even if we also consider other phases, we are confident that our results focusing on the model- ing phase will help the research community to broaden their vision on this topic. Finally, it is worth noticing that, according to the EC.1 Criterion, we only con- sider research works written in the English language, meaning that there may be related works written in other languages that was not included. The data validityaims to validate the data extrac- tion, and the analysis of secondary studies [1]. Exam- ples of threats in this category are data collection bias and analysis bias. Different researchers might interpret a study differently, especially regarding the classifica- tion of extracted data. In this regard, we used an online Google worksheet during data extraction. In this way, the authors shared and discussed the data extracted. We also run a cross-check consisting of a continuous re- vision of the data by researchers not directly involved in the original data extraction. Finally, we solved con- flicts during the cross-check revision process using dis- cussions. Although we aimed to give the exact defini- tions and instructions for extracting data from the in- cluded studies in Subsection 4.2, some values might still be subjective. The research validity aims to validate all the phases of the secondary research method and concern coverage of research questions and survey repeatability [1]. To address the threat of the research coverage, in Section 3 we proposed three main research questions, focusing on the modeling views, IoT requirements, and modeling notations. We concentrate the analysis in the context of a top-down approach investigating mainly the modeling phase. An exception was made for the ex- ecution phase as it may bring relevant information to the research of an IoT-Aware modeling approach. Other phases like monitoring and mining are out of scope for this research effort. The last research question contains three fundamental sub-questions for extracting relevant information for the research. To ensure the repeatabil- ity of the work reported in this article, in Section 2, we carefully described the search protocol that reports the use of a systematic process that researchers can replicate. This can open the possibility of making sub- sequent additions and extensions to the research in this field. 7 Related work While scouting the literature for retrieving scientific contributions concerning modeling IoT-Aware business processes, we found six secondary studies with simi- lar objectives concerning our work. Table 18 provides an overview and emphasizes the differences between these papers. We categorized these works based on the methodology applied by the authors for conducting and reporting the research, i.e., Systematic/Not System- atic. Some of them are systematic literature reviews [51, 108, 110], while others propose overviews of works related to our topic [10, 17, 41] without adopting a sys- tematic strategy. Systematic Reviews. Torres et al. [110] performed a systematic mapping study, considering the time frame 2009-2019, to collect and describe ways to model IoT- enhanced business processes. They considered two re- search questions that guided their search: (i) Which modeling strategies are provided to build IoT-enhanced BPs?; (ii) How IoT devices are represented at the mod- eling level?. They gathered research works using a query over a set of digital libraries (i.e., Scopus, Science Di- rect, Google Scholar, Springer, Crossref search). The entire procedure resulted in a collection of 36 primary A Systematic Literature Review on IoT-Aware Business Process Modeling Views, Requirements and Notations 31 Review Methodology Publ.

Table 18: IoT-Aware business processes related literature reviews studies. In terms of gathered research works, we share with Torres et al. [110] an intersection of 27 primary studies. However, they do not focus on the detail of the languages concerning modeling views and requirements. In addition, the methodology they used for gathering such a collection of primary studies is not fully docu- mented, which hinders the possibility of replicating the study to clarify better the differences between the sets considered by them and us, respectively. Graja et al. [51] produces a survey on existing ap- proaches to model Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), con- sidering the time frame 2009-2016. They study CPS properties, classify modeling technologies, and review some existing approaches discussing their importance in different application domains. The following research questions guided the research work: (i) Which mod- eling languages are used to specify CPS ?; (ii) What are the supported CPS aspects within the modeling ap- proaches? Which non-functional properties are speci- fied when modeling these systems ?; (iii) What are the studied application domains of CPS ?. They gathered 35 research works using a query over a set of digital libraries (i.e., IEEE, Science Direct, Google Scholar, ACM, Springer). Even though the authors target the modeling of CPS in its wider form, they also identified four different approaches that model CPS from a busi- ness process perspective. We considered these works rel- evant for our survey and included them in our analysis. Teixeira et al. [108] performed a systematic map- ping study investigating the modeling and automatic code generation initiatives for Wireless Sensor Network applications based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard con- sidering the time frame 2005-2015. This research was based on the following five research questions:(i) Which high-level aspects are treated by the modeling or code generation process?; (ii) Which strategies are used for controlling or reducing the node energy consumption? ; (iii) Is there any middleware supporting the modeling or code generation process ?; (iv) Does the approach for modeling and code generation apply some service- orientation in their conceptual architecture or deploy- ment process ?; (v) Does the approach allow any dy- namic code update after the code generation process ? They gathered research works using a query over a set of digital libraries (i.e., Scopus, WoS, IEEE, Sci- ence Direct, ACM, Springer, Compendex). Even though this study presents a significant amount of retrieved re- search works (55), it focuses on aspects related to the technology used by the various approaches, the kind of supported middleware, and the proposed service- oriented architecture. Therefore, while limiting the no- tation comparison to the support for aspects linked to WSN (e.g., energy consumption), they miss some less specific notations retrieved by us. Moreover, the iden- tified modeling notations were published in 2005-2015, so they do not include more recent works. Despite that, we considered this work related to ours since it also re- ports some approaches for modeling WSN from a busi- ness process perspective. Indeed, ten works mentioned in this survey have also been included in our SLR. Not Systematic. Fattouch et al. [41], present a re- view of different approaches that integrate the IoT tech- nology within business processes, considering the time frame 2014-2020. They provide a brief overview of each approach and compare them based on a set of criteria. They also identify some initiatives and challenges for the IoT-Aware business process paradigm. This work shares our objective, and there is an intersection of 15 works between the two surveys. Brouns et al. [10] provide an IBM report targeting the modeling of IoT-Aware business processes consid- ering the time frame 2010-2018. The work overviews some BPMN extensions incorporating IoT aspects in business process models. We share with this work an intersection of 15 primary studies. Chang et al. [17] provide an analysis of existing Business Process Management Systems for IoT frame- works and identifies the limitations, and their draw- backs, based on a mobile cloud computing perspec- tive considering the time frame 2012-2016. They also summarize some BPMN extensions incorporating IoT aspects into business process models. Considering its 32 Ivan Compagnucci1 et al. specificity, we share an intersection of 8 primary stud- ies with this work. General Remarks. Compared to the identified re- lated works, our research presents a wider set of papers discussing modeling IoT-Aware business processes. In particular, this stems from the fact that our SLR cov- ers a wider period (1999-2020), resulting in a larger set of identified primary studies. Moreover, the reviews in- cluded as related works do not focus their analysis on the types of views and requirements that are supported by the notations under scrutiny. In addition, the comparison highlights the differ- ence between adopting a systematic approach versus a non-systematic one; the latter generally results into a smaller set of retrieved primary studies. Overall, the considered non-systematic literature misses many re- search works that we instead found by applying a sys- tematic approach. The drawback of the systematic ap- proach is that it is more demanding concerning the time needed. We also observe that relatively small dif- ferences in the definition of the research questions can result in significant differences in the set of considered primary works. The results are strongly connected to possible differences in the choice of the keywords used to compose the query and the adoption of different In- clusion/Exclusion criteria [26]. Finally, we observe that some papers included in the other systematic surveys were not included in our study. Most of the excluded research works were ini- tially identified by our search query. However, they were then discarded by the application of the exclusion cri- teria EC.2 after having read the title and abstract. They do not propose or use a process-oriented notation to model IoT-Aware business processes. Notice that our focus is more specific, and modeling cyber-physical sys- tems and wireless sensor networks without directly re- ferring to the business processes-oriented vision in a top-down approach was not relevant for our study. 8 Conclusion This paper reports the results of a Systematic Litera- ture Review on modeling notations for IoT-Aware busi- ness processes. The SLR has been conducted adopting Kitchenham\u2019s guidelines [64], moreover backward and forward snowballing steps [60, 113] were applied to im- prove the recall of our SLR. The considered methodol- ogy has been described to permit the full replicability of the study. As a result of searching and filtering activ- ities, we selected and analyzed 84 research works. This literature review can guide modelers in choosing the no- tation that better fits their needs to model IoT-Aware business processes. We introduced the need to merge business processes and the Internet of Things aspects. Then, after discussing the methodology, we organized the sections reflecting the followed systematic protocol: planning (Sec. 3), conducting (Sec. 4), and reporting (Sec. 5). Answering our research questions, we recognized that modeling notations for IoT-Aware business pro- cesses result in being a hot topic, both considering Pro- cess of Things and Things-aware Process type of views. During our study, we observed that a lack of standard- ization led to the definition of different modeling no- tations. However, they do not fit all the IoT-related requirements mentioned by Meyer et al. [84], typically used by the community as a reference for comparing IoT-Aware business process notations. We also discuss the use of the notations concerning specific application domains, and we underline a general lack of tool sup- port for using the notations proposed by the various research works. Finally, we pointed out some research directions for future works related to IoT-Aware busi- ness processes, which embrace all the business process life-cycle phases instead of focusing only on the design phase.
